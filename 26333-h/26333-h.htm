<blockquote><blockquote><i>
I step across the mystic border-land,<br>
And look upon the wonder-world of Art.<br>
How beautiful, how beautiful its hills!<br>
And all its valleys, how surpassing fair!<br>

<br>

The winding paths that lead up to the heights<br>
Are polished by the footsteps of the great.<br>
The mountain&#8209;peaks stand very near to God:<br>
The chosen few whose feet have trod thereon<br>
Have talked with Him, and with the angels walked.<br>

<br>

Here are no sounds of discord&#8212;no profane<br>
Or senseless gossip of unworthy things&#8212;<br>
Only the songs of chisels and of pens.<br>
Of busy brushes, and ecstatic strains<br>
Of souls surcharged with music most divine.<br>
Here is no idle sorrow, no poor grief<br>
For any day or object left behind&#8212;<br>
For time is counted precious, and herein<br>
Is such complete abandonment of Self<br>
That tears turn into rainbows, and enhance<br>
The beauty of the land where all is fair.<br>

<br>

Awed and afraid, I cross the border&#8209;land.<br>
Oh, who am I, that I dare enter here<br>
Where the great artists of the world have trod&#8212;<br>
The genius&#8209;crowned aristocrats of Earth?<br>
Only the singer of a little song;<br>
Yet loving Art with such a mighty love<br>
I hold it greater to have won a place<br>
Just on the fair land's edge, to make my grave,<br>
Than in the outer world of greed and gain<br>
To sit upon a royal throne and reign.<br>

<h4><i>PART I.</i></h4>

<blockquote><blockquote>
I sat and sewed, and sang some tender tune,<br>
Oh, beauteous was that morn in early June!<br>
Mellow with sunlight, and with blossoms fair:<br>
The climbing rose&#8209;tree grew about me there,<br>
And checked with shade the sunny portico<br>
Where, morns like this, I came to read, or sew.<br>

<br>

I heard the gate click, and a firm quick tread<br>
Upon the walk. No need to turn my head;<br>
I would mistake, and doubt my own voice sounding,<br>
Before his step upon the gravel bounding.<br>
In an unstudied attitude of grace,<br>
He stretched his comely form; and from his face<br>
He tossed the dark, damp curls; and at my knees,<br>
With his broad hat he fanned the lazy breeze,<br>
And turned his head, and lifted his large eyes,<br>
Of that strange hue we see in ocean dyes,<br>
And call it blue sometimes, and sometimes green<br>
And save in poet eyes, not elsewhere seen.<br>

<br>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 10]</span>"Lest I should meet with my fair lady's scorning,<br>
For calling quite so early in the morning,<br>
I've brought a passport that can never fail,"<br>
He said, and, laughing, laid the morning mail<br>
Upon my lap. "I'm welcome? so I thought!<br>
I'll figure by the letters that I brought<br>
How glad you are to see me. Only one?<br>
And that one from a lady? I'm undone!<br>
That, lightly skimmed, you'll think me <i>such</i> a bore,<br>
And wonder why I did not bring you four.<br>
It's ever thus: a woman cannot get<br>
So many letters that she will not fret<br>
O'er one that did not come."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'll prove you wrong,"<br>
I answered gayly, "here upon the spot!<br>
This little letter, precious if not long,<br>
Is just the one, of all you might have brought,<br>
To please me. You have heard me speak, I'm sure,<br>
Of Helen Trevor: she writes here to say<br>
She's coming out to see me; and will stay<br>
Till Autumn, maybe. She is, like her note,<br>
Petite and dainty, tender, loving, pure.<br>
You'd know her by a letter that she wrote,<br>
For a sweet tinted thing. 'Tis always so:&#8212;<br>
Letters all blots, though finely written, show<br>
A slovenly person. Letters stiff and white<br>
Bespeak a nature honest, plain, upright.<br>
And tissuey, tinted, perfumed notes, like this,<br>
Tell of a creature formed to pet and kiss."<br>

<br>

My listener heard me with a slow, odd smile;<br>
Stretched in abandon at my feet, the while,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 11]</span>He fanned me idly with his broad&#8209;brimmed hat.<br>
"Then all young ladies must be formed for that!"<br>
He laughed, and said.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Their letters read, and look,<br>
As like as twenty copies of one book.<br>
They're written in a dainty, spider scrawl,<br>
To 'darling, precious Kate,' or 'Fan,' or 'Moll.'<br>
The 'dearest, sweetest' friend they ever had.<br>
They say they 'want to see you, oh, so bad!'<br>
Vow they'll 'forget you, never, _never_, oh!'<br>
And then they tell about a splendid beau&#8212;<br>
A lovely hat&#8212;a charming dress, and send<br>
A little scrap of this to every friend.<br>
And then to close, for lack of something better,<br>
They beg you'll 'read and burn this horrid letter.'"<br>

<br>

He watched me, smiling. He was prone to vex<br>
And hector me with flings upon my sex.<br>
He liked, he said, to have me flash and frown,<br>
So he could tease me, and then laugh me down.<br>
My storms of wrath amused him very much:<br>
He liked to see me go off at a touch;<br>
Anger became me&#8212;made my color rise,<br>
And gave an added luster to my eyes.<br>
So he would talk&#8212;and so he watched me now,<br>
To see the hot flush mantle cheek and brow.<br>

<br>

Instead, I answered coolly, with a smile,<br>
Felling a seam with utmost care, meanwhile.<br>
"The caustic tongue of Vivian Dangerfield<br>
Is barbed as ever, for my sex, this morn.<br>
Still unconvinced, no smallest point I yield.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 12]</span>Woman I love, and trust, despite your scorn.<br>
There is some truth in what you say? Well, yes!<br>
Your statements usually hold more or less.<br>
Some women write weak letters&#8212;(some men do;)<br>
Some make professions, knowing them untrue.<br>
And woman's friendship, in the time of need,<br>
I own, too often proves a broken reed.<br>
But I believe, and ever will contend,<br>
Woman can be a sister woman's friend,<br>
Giving from out her large heart's bounteous store<br>
A living love&#8212;claiming to do no more<br>
Than, through and by that love, she knows she can;<br>
And living by her professions, _like a man_.<br>
And such a tie, true friendship's silken tether,<br>
Binds Helen Trevor's heart and mine together.<br>
I love her for her beauty, meekness, grace;<br>
For her white lily soul and angel face.<br>
She loves me, for my greater strength, may be;<br>
Loves&#8212;and would give her heart's best blood for me<br>
And I, to save her from a pain, or cross,<br>
Would suffer any sacrifice or loss.<br>
Such can be woman's friendship for another.<br>
Could man give more, or ask more from a brother?"<br>

<br>

I paused: and Vivian leaned his massive head<br>
Against the pillar of the portico,<br>
Smiled his slow, skeptic smile, then laughed, and said:<br>
"Nay, surely not&#8212;if what you say be so.<br>
You've made a statement, but no proof's at hand.<br>
Wait&#8212;do not flash your eyes so! Understand<br>
I think you quite sincere in what you say:<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 13]</span>You love your friend, and she loves you, to&#8209;day;<br>
But friendship is not friendship at the best<br>
Till circumstances put it to the test.<br>
Man's, less demonstrative, stands strain and tear,<br>
While woman's, half profession, fails to wear.<br>
Two women love each other passing well&#8212;<br>
Say Helen Trevor and Maurine La Pelle,<br>
Just for example.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Let them daily meet<br>
At ball and concert, in the church and street,<br>
They kiss and coo, they visit, chat, caress;<br>
Their love increases, rather than grows less;<br>
And all goes well, till 'Helen dear' discovers<br>
That 'Maurine darling' wins too many lovers.<br>

<br>

And then her 'precious friend,' her 'pet,' her 'sweet,'<br>
Becomes a 'minx,' a 'creature all deceit.'<br>
Let Helen smile too oft on Maurine's beaux,<br>
Or wear more stylish or becoming clothes,<br>
Or sport a hat that has a longer feather&#8212;<br>
And lo! the strain has broken 'friendship's tether.'<br>
Maurine's sweet smile becomes a frown or pout;<br>
'She's just begun to find that Helen out'<br>
The breach grows wider&#8212;anger fills each heart;<br>
They drift asunder, whom 'but death could part.'<br>
You shake your head? Oh, well, we'll never know!<br>
It is not likely Fate will test you so.<br>
You'll live, and love; and, meeting twice a year,<br>
While life shall last, you'll hold each other dear.<br>
I pray it may be so; it were not best<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 14]</span>To shake your faith in woman by the test.<br>
Keep your belief, and nurse it while you can.<br>
I've faith in woman's friendship too&#8212;for man!<br>
They're true as steel, as mothers, friends, and wives:<br>
And that's enough to bless us all our lives.<br>
That man's a selfish fellow, and a bore,<br>
Who is unsatisfied, and asks for more."<br>

<br>

"But there is need of more!" I here broke in.<br>
"I hold that woman guilty of a sin,<br>
Who would not cling to, and defend another,<br>
As nobly as she would stand by a brother.<br>
Who would not suffer for a sister's sake,<br>
And, were there need to prove her friendship, make<br>
'Most any sacrifice, nor count the cost.<br>
Who would not do this for a friend is lost<br>
To every nobler principle."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Shame, shame!"<br>
Cried Vivian, laughing, "for you now defame<br>
The whole sweet sex; since there's not one would do<br>
The thing you name, nor would I want her to.<br>
I love the sex. My mother was a woman&#8212;<br>
I hope my wife will be, and wholly human.<br>
And if she wants to make some sacrifice,<br>
I'll think her far more sensible and wise<br>
To let her husband reap the benefit,<br>
Instead of some old maid or senseless chit.<br>
Selfish? Of course! I hold all love is so:<br>
And I shall love my wife right well, I know.<br>
Now there's a point regarding selfish love,<br>
You thirst to argue with me, and disprove.<br>
But since these cosy hours will soon be gone<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 15]</span>And all our meetings broken in upon,<br>
No more of these rare moments must be spent<br>
In vain discussions, or in argument.<br>
I wish Miss Trevor was in&#8212;Jericho!<br>
(You see the selfishness begins to show.)<br>
She wants to see you?&#8212;So do I: but she<br>
Will gain her wish, by taking you from me.<br>
'Come all the same?' that means I'll be allowed<br>
To realize that 'three can make a crowd.'<br>
I do not like to feel myself _de trop_.<br>
With two girl cronies would I not be so?<br>
My ring would interrupt some private chat.<br>
You'd ask me in and take my cane and hat,<br>
And speak about the lovely summer day,<br>
And think&#8212;'The lout! I wish he'd kept away.'<br>
Miss Trevor'd smile, but just to hide a pout<br>
And count the moments till I was shown out.<br>
And, while I twirled my thumbs, I would sit wishing<br>
That I had gone off hunting birds, or fishing.<br>
No, thanks, Maurine! The iron hand of Fate,<br>
(Or otherwise Miss Trevor's dainty fingers,)<br>
Will bar my entrance into Eden's gate;<br>
And I shall be like some poor soul that lingers<br>
At heaven's portal, paying the price of sin,<br>
Yet hoping to be pardoned and let in."<br>

<br>

He looked so melancholy sitting there,<br>
I laughed outright. "How well you act a part;<br>
You look the very picture of despair!<br>
You've missed your calling, sir! suppose you start<br>
Upon a starring tour, and carve your name<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 16]</span>With Booth's and Barrett's on the heights of Fame.<br>
But now, tabooing nonsense, I shall send<br>
For you to help me entertain my friend,<br>
Unless you come without it. 'Cronies?' True,<br>
Wanting our 'private chats' as cronies do<br>
And we'll take those, while you are reading Greek,<br>
Or writing 'Lines to Dora's brow' or 'cheek.'<br>
But when you have an hour or two of leisure,<br>
Call as you now do, and afford like pleasure.<br>
For never yet did heaven's sun shine on,<br>
Or stars discover, that phenomenon,<br>
In any country, or in any clime:<br>
Two maids so bound, by ties of mind and heart.<br>
They did not feel the heavy weight of time<br>
In weeks of scenes wherein no man took part.<br>
God made the sexes to associate:<br>
Nor law of man, nor stern decree of Fate,<br>
Can ever undo what His hand has done,<br>
And, quite alone, make happy either one.<br>
My Helen is an only child:&#8212;a pet<br>
Of loving parents: and she never yet<br>
Has been denied one boon for which she pleaded.<br>
A fragile thing, her lightest wish was heeded.<br>
Would she pluck roses? they must first be shorn,<br>
By careful hands, of every hateful thorn.<br>
And loving eyes must scan the pathway where<br>
Her feet may tread, to see no stones are there.<br>
She'll grow dull here, in this secluded nook,<br>
Unless you aid me in the pleasant task<br>
Of entertaining. Drop in with your book&#8212;<br>
Read, talk, sing for her sometimes. What I ask,<br>
Do once, to please me: then there'll be no need<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 17]</span>For me to state the case again, or plead.<br>
There's nothing like a woman's grace and beauty<br>
To waken mankind to a sense of duty."<br>

<br>

"I bow before the mandate of my queen:<br>
Your slightest wish is law, Ma Belle Maurine,"<br>
He answered smiling, "I'm at your command;<br>
Point but one lily finger, or your wand,<br>
And you will find a willing slave obeying.<br>
There goes my dinner bell! I hear it saying<br>
I've spent two hours here, lying at your feet,<br>
Not profitable, maybe&#8212;surely sweet.<br>
All time is money; now were I to measure<br>
The time I spend here by its solid pleasure,<br>
And that were coined in dollars, then I've laid<br>
Each day a fortune at your feet, fair maid.<br>
There goes that bell again! I'll say good&#8209;bye,<br>
Or clouds will shadow my domestic sky.<br>
I'll come again, as you would have me do,<br>
And see your friend, while she is seeing you.<br>
That's like by proxy being at a feast;<br>
Unsatisfactory, to say the least."<br>

<br>

He drew his fine shape up, and trod the land<br>
With kingly grace. Passing the gate, his hand<br>
He lightly placed the garden wall upon,<br>
Leaped over like a leopard, and was gone.<br>

<br>

And, going, took the brightness from the place,<br>
Yet left the June day with a sweeter grace,<br>
And my young soul so steeped in happy dreams,<br>
Heaven itself seemed shown to me in gleams.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 18]</span>There is a time with lovers, when the heart<br>
First slowly rouses from its dreamless sleep,<br>
To all the tumult of a passion life,<br>
Ere yet have wakened jealousy and strife.<br>
Just as a young, untutored child will start<br>
Out of a long hour's slumber, sound and deep,<br>
And lie and smile with rosy lips, and cheeks,<br>
In a sweet, restful trance, before it speaks.<br>
A time when yet no word the spell has broken,<br>
Save what the heart unto the soul has spoken,<br>
In quickened throbs, and sighs but half suppressed.<br>
A time when that sweet truth, all unconfessed,<br>
Gives added fragrance to the summer flowers,<br>
A golden glory to the passing hours,<br>
A hopeful beauty to the plainest face,<br>
And lends to life a new and tender grace.<br>

<br>

When the full heart has climbed the heights of bliss,<br>
And, smiling, looks back o'er the golden past,<br>
I think it finds no sweeter hour than this<br>
In all love&#8209;life. For, later, when the last<br>
Translucent drop o'erflows the cup of joy,<br>
And love, more mighty than the heart's control,<br>
Surges in words of passion from the soul,<br>
And vows are asked and given, shadows rise<br>
Like mists before the sun in noonday skies,<br>
Vague fears, that prove the brimming cup's alloy;<br>
A dread of change&#8212;the crowning moment's curse,<br>
Since what is perfect, change but renders worse:<br>
A vain desire to cripple Time, who goes<br>
Bearing our joys away, and bringing woes.<br>
And later, doubts and jealousies awaken.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 19]</span>And plighted hearts are tempest&#8209;tossed, and shaken.<br>
Doubt sends a test, that goes a step too far,<br>
A wound is made, that, healing, leaves a scar,<br>
Or one heart, full with love's sweet satisfaction,<br>
Thinks truth once spoken always understood,<br>
While one is pining for the tender action<br>
And whispered word by which, of old, 'twas wooed.<br>

<br>

But this blest hour, in love's glad, golden day,<br>
Is like the dawning, ere the radiant ray<br>
Of glowing Sol has burst upon the eye,<br>
But yet is heralded in earth and sky,<br>
Warm with its fervor, mellow with its light,<br>
While Care still slumbers in the arms of night.<br>
But Hope, awake, hears happy birdlings sing,<br>
And thinks of all a summer day may bring.<br>

<br>

In this sweet calm, my young heart lay at rest,<br>
Filled with a blissful sense of peace; nor guessed<br>
That sullen clouds were gathering in the skies<br>
To hide the glorious sun, ere it should rise.<br>

<blockquote><blockquote>
To little birds that never tire of humming<br>
About the garden, in the summer weather,<br>
Aunt Ruth compared us, after Helen's coming,<br>
As we two roamed, or sat and talked together.<br>
Twelve months apart, we had so much to say<br>
Of school days gone&#8212;and time since passed away;<br>
Of that old friend, and this; of what we'd done;<br>
Of how our separate paths in life had run;<br>
Of what we would do, in the coming years;<br>
Of plans and castles, hopes and dreams and fears.<br>
All these, and more, as soon as we found speech,<br>
We touched upon, and skimmed from this to that<br>
But at the first, each only gazed on each,<br>
And, dumb with joy, that did not need a voice<br>
Like lesser joys, to say, "Lo! I rejoice,"<br>
With smiling eyes and clasping hands we sat<br>
Wrapped in that peace, felt but with those dear,<br>
Contented just to know each other near.<br>
But when this silent eloquence gave place<br>
To words, 'twas like the rising of a flood<br>
Above a dam. We sat there, face to face,<br>
And let our talk glide on where'er it would,<br>
Speech never halting in its speed or zest,<br>
Save when our rippling laughter let it rest;<br>
Just as a stream will sometimes pause and play<br>
About a bubbling spring, then dash away.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 21]</span>No wonder, then, the third day's sun was nigh<br>
Up to the zenith when my friend and I<br>
Opened our eyes from slumber long and deep:<br>
Nature demanding recompense for hours<br>
Spent in the portico, among the flowers,<br>
Halves of two nights we should have spent in sleep.<br>

<br>

So this third day, we breakfasted at one:<br>
Then walked about the garden in the sun,<br>
Hearing the thrushes and the robins sing,<br>
And looking to see what buds were opening.<br>

<br>

The clock chimed three, and we yet strayed at will<br>
About the yard in morning dishabille,<br>
When Aunt Ruth came, with apron o'er her head,<br>
Holding a letter in her hand, and said,<br>
"Here is a note, from Vivian I opine;<br>
At least his servant brought it. And now, girls,<br>
You may think this is no concern of mine,<br>
But in my day young ladies did not go,<br>
Till almost bed&#8209;time roaming to and fro<br>
In morning wrappers, and with tangled curls,<br>
The very pictures of forlorn distress.<br>
'Tis three o'clock, and time for you to dress.<br>
Come! read your note and hurry in, Maurine,<br>
And make yourself fit object to be seen."<br>

<br>

Helen was bending o'er an almond bush,<br>
And ere she looked up I had read the note,<br>
And calmed my heart, that, bounding, sent a flush<br>
To brow and cheek, at sight of aught <i>he</i> wrote.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 22]</span>"Ma Belle Maurine:" (so Vivian's billet ran,)<br>
"Is it not time I saw your cherished guest?<br>
'Pity the sorrows of a poor young man,'<br>
Banished from all that makes existence blest.<br>
I'm dying to see&#8212;your friend; and I will come<br>
And pay respects, hoping you'll be at home<br>
To&#8209;night at eight. Expectantly, V. D."<br>

<br>

Inside my belt I slipped the billet, saying,<br>
"Helen, go make yourself most fair to see:<br>
Quick! hurry now! no time for more delaying!<br>
In just five hours a caller will be here,<br>
And you must look your prettiest, my dear!<br>
Begin your toilet right away. I know<br>
How long it takes you to arrange each bow&#8212;<br>
To twist each curl, and loop your skirts aright.<br>
And you must prove you are <i>au fait</i> to&#8209;night,<br>
And make a perfect toilet: for our caller<br>
Is man, and critic, poet, artist, scholar,<br>
And views with eyes of all."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, oh! Maurine,"<br>
Cried Helen with a well&#8209;feigned look of fear,<br>
"You've frightened me so I shall not appear:<br>
I'll hide away, refusing to be seen<br>
By such an ogre. Woe is me! bereft<br>
Of all my friends, my peaceful home I've left,<br>
And strayed away into the dreadful wood<br>
To meet the fate of poor Red Riding Hood.<br>
No, Maurine, no! you've given me such a fright,<br>
I'll not go near your ugly wolf to&#8209;night."<br>

<br>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 23]</span>Meantime we'd left the garden; and I stood<br>
In Helen's room, where she had thrown herself<br>
Upon a couch, and lay, a winsome elf,<br>
Pouting and smiling, cheek upon her arm,<br>
Not in the least a portrait of alarm.<br>
"Now sweet!" I coaxed, and knelt by her, "be good!<br>
Go curl your hair; and please your own Maurine,<br>
By putting on that lovely grenadine.<br>
Not wolf, nor ogre, neither Caliban,<br>
Nor Mephistopheles, you'll meet to&#8209;night,<br>
But what the ladies call 'a nice young man'!<br>
Yet one worth knowing&#8212;strong with health and might<br>
Of perfect manhood; gifted, noble, wise;<br>
Moving among his kind with loving eyes,<br>
And helpful hand; progressive, brave, refined,<br>
After the image of his Maker's mind."<br>

<br>

"Now, now, Maurine!" cried Helen, "I believe<br>
It is your lover coming here this eve.<br>
Why have you never written of him, pray?<br>
Is the day set?&#8212;and when? Say, Maurine, say!"<br>

<br>

Had I betrayed by some too fervent word<br>
The secret love that all my being stirred?<br>
My lover? Ay! My heart proclaimed him so;<br>
But first <i>his</i> lips must win the sweet confession,<br>
Ere even Helen be allowed to know.<br>
I must straightway erase the slight impression<br>
Made by the words just uttered.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 24]</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Foolish child!"<br>
I gayly cried, "your fancy's straying wild.<br>
Just let a girl of eighteen hear the name<br>
Of maid and youth uttered about one time,<br>
And off her fancy goes, at break&#8209;neck pace,<br>
Defying circumstances, reason, space&#8212;<br>
And straightway builds romances so sublime<br>
They put all Shakespeare's dramas to the shame.<br>
This Vivian Dangerfield is neighbor, friend<br>
And kind companion; bringing books and flowers.<br>
And, by his thoughtful actions without end,<br>
Helping me pass some otherwise long hours;<br>
But he has never breathed a word of love.<br>
If you still doubt me, listen while I prove<br>
My statement by the letter that he wrote.<br>
'Dying to meet&#8212;my friend!' (she could not see<br>
The dash between that meant so much to me.)<br>
'Will come this eve, at eight, and hopes we may<br>
Be in to greet him.' Now I think you'll say<br>
'Tis not much like a lover's tender note."<br>

<br>

We laugh, we jest, not meaning what we say;<br>
We hide our thoughts, by light words lightly spoken,<br>
And pass on heedless, till we find one day<br>
They've bruised our hearts, or left some other broken.<br>

<br>

I sought my room, and trilling some blithe air,<br>
Opened my wardrobe, wondering what to wear.<br>
Momentous question! femininely human!<br>
More than all others, vexing mind of woman,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 25]</span>Since that sad day, when in her discontent,<br>
To search for leaves, our fair first mother went.<br>
All undecided what I should put on,<br>
At length I made selection of a lawn&#8212;<br>
White, with a tiny pink vine overrun:&#8212;<br>
My simplest robe, but Vivian's favorite one.<br>
And placing a single flowret in my hair,<br>
I crossed the hall to Helen's chamber, where<br>
I found her with her fair locks all let down,<br>
Brushing the kinks out, with a pretty frown.<br>
'T was like a picture, or a pleasing play,<br>
To watch her make her toilet. She would stand,<br>
And turn her head first this and then that way,<br>
Trying effect of ribbon, bow or band.<br>
Then she would pick up something else, and curve<br>
Her lovely neck, with cunning, bird&#8209;like grace,<br>
And watch the mirror while she put it on,<br>
With such a sweetly grave and thoughtful face;<br>
And then to view it all would sway, and swerve<br>
Her lithe young body, like a graceful swan.<br>

<br>

Helen was over medium height, and slender<br>
Even to frailty. Her great, wistful eyes<br>
Were like the deep blue of autumnal skies;<br>
And through them looked her soul, large, loving, tender.<br>
Her long, light hair was lusterless, except<br>
Upon the ends, where burnished sunbeams slept,<br>
And on the earlocks; and she looped the curls<br>
Back with a shell comb, studded thick with pearls,<br>
Costly yet simple. Her pale loveliness,<br>
That night, was heightened by her rich, black dress,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 26]</span>That trailed behind her, leaving half in sight<br>
Her taper arms, and shoulders marble white.<br>

<br>

I was not tall as Helen, and my face<br>
Was shaped and colored like my grandsire's race;<br>
For through his veins my own received the warm,<br>
Red blood of southern France, which curved my form,<br>
And glowed upon my cheek in crimson dyes,<br>
And bronzed my hair, and darkled in my eyes.<br>
And as the morning trails the skirts of night,<br>
And dusky night puts on the garb of morn,<br>
And walk together when the day is born,<br>
So we two glided down the hall and stair,<br>
Arm clasping arm, into the parlor, where<br>
Sat Vivian, bathed in sunset's gorgeous light.<br>
He rose to greet us. Oh! his form was grand;<br>
And he possessed that power, strange, occult,<br>
Called magnetism, lacking better word,<br>
Which moves the world, achieving great result<br>
Where genius fails completely. Touch his hand,<br>
It thrilled through all your being&#8212;meet his eye,<br>
And you were moved, yet knew not how, or why.<br>
Let him but rise, you felt the air was stirred<br>
By an electric current.<br>

<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This strange force<br>
Is mightier than genius. Rightly used,<br>
It leads to grand achievements; all things yield<br>
Before its mystic presence, and its field<br>
Is broad as earth and heaven. But abused,<br>
It sweeps like a poison simoon on its course<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 27]</span>Bearing miasma in its scorching breath,<br>
And leaving all it touches struck with death.<br>

<br>

Far&#8209;reaching science shall yet tear away<br>
The mystic garb that hides it from the day,<br>
And drag it forth and bind it with its laws,<br>
And make it serve the purposes of men,<br>
Guided by common sense and reason. Then<br>
We'll hear no more of seance, table&#8209;rapping,<br>
And all that trash, o'er which the world is gaping,<br>
Lost in effect, while science seeks the cause.<br>

<br>

Vivian was not conscious of his power:<br>
Or, if he was, knew not its full extent.<br>
He knew his glance would make a wild beast cower,<br>
And yet he knew not that his large eyes sent<br>
Into the heart of woman the same thrill<br>
That made the lion servant of his will.<br>
And even strong men felt it.<br>

<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He arose,<br>
Reached forth his hand, and in it clasped my own,<br>
While I held Helen's; and he spoke some word<br>
Of pleasant greeting in his low, round tone,<br>
Unlike all other voices I have heard.<br>
Just as the white cloud, at the sunrise, glows<br>
With roseate colors, so the pallid hue<br>
Of Helen's cheek, like tinted sea&#8209;shells grew.<br>
Through mine, his hand caused hers to tremble; such<br>
Was the all&#8209;mast'ring magic of his touch.<br>

<br>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 28]</span>Then we sat down, and talked about the weather,<br>
The neighborhood&#8212;some author's last new book.<br>
But, when I could, I left the two together<br>
To make acquaintance, saying I must look<br>
After the chickens&#8212;my especial care;<br>
And ran away, and left them, laughing, there.<br>

<br>

Knee&#8209;deep, through clover, to the poplar grove,<br>
I waded, where my pets were wont to rove:<br>
And there I found the foolish mother hen<br>
Brooding her chickens underneath a tree,<br>
An easy prey for foxes. "Chick&#8209;a&#8209;dee,"<br>
Quoth I, while reaching for the downy things<br>
That, chirping, peeped from out the mother&#8209;wings,<br>
"How very human is your folly! When<br>
There waits a haven, pleasant, bright, and warm,<br>
And one to lead you thither from the storm<br>
And lurking dangers, yet you turn away.<br>
And, thinking to be your own protector, stray<br>
Into the open jaws of death: for, see!<br>
An owl is sitting in this very tree<br>
You thought safe shelter. Go now to your pen."<br>
And, followed by the clucking, clamorous hen,<br>
So like the human mother here again,<br>
Moaning because a strong, protecting arm<br>
Would shield her little ones from cold and harm,<br>
I carried back my garden hat brimful<br>
Of chirping chickens, like white balls of wool,<br>
And snugly housed them.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And just then I heard<br>
A sound like gentle winds among the trees,<br>
Or pleasant waters in the Summer, stirred<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 29]</span>And set in motion by a passing breeze.<br>
'T was Helen singing: and, as I drew near,<br>
Another voice, a tenor full and clear,<br>
Mingled with hers, as murmuring streams unite,<br>
And flow on stronger in their wedded might.<br>
It was a way of Helen's, not to sing<br>
The songs that other people sang. She took<br>
Sometimes an extract from an ancient book;<br>
Again some floating, fragmentary thing<br>
And such she fitted to old melodies,<br>
Or else composed the music. One of these<br>
She sang that night; and Vivian caught the strain,<br>
And joined her in the chorus, or refrain,

<blockquote>

O thou, mine other, stronger part!<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whom yet I cannot hear, or see,<br>
Come thou, and take this loving heart,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That longs to yield its all to thee,<br>

This hungry heart, so warm, so large,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Is far too great a care for me.<br>
I have grown weary of the charge<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I keep so sacredly for thee.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Come thou, and take my heart from me.<br>

I am aweary, waiting here<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For one who tarries long from me.<br>
O! art thou far, or art thou near?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And must I still be sad for thee?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or wilt thou straightway come to me?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Love, answer, I am near to thee,<br>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 30]</span>The melody, so full of plaintive chords,<br>
Sobbed into silence&#8212;echoing down the strings<br>
Like voice of one who walks from us, and sings.<br>
Vivian had leaned upon the instrument<br>
The while they sang. But, as he spoke those words,<br>
"Love, I am near to thee, I come to thee,"<br>
He turned his grand head slowly round, and bent<br>
His lustrous, soulful, speaking gaze on me.<br>
And my young heart, eager to own its king,<br>
Sent to my eyes a great, glad, trustful light<br>
Of love and faith, and hung upon my cheek<br>
Hope's rose&#8209;hued flag. There was no need to speak.<br>
I crossed the room, and knelt by Helen. "Sing<br>
That song you sang a fragment of one night,<br>
Out on the porch, beginning, 'Praise me not,'"<br>
I whispered: and her sweet and plaintive tone<br>
Rose, low and tender, as if she had caught<br>
From some sad passing breeze, and made her own,<br>
The echo of the wind&#8209;harp's sighing strain,<br>
Or the soft music of the falling rain.<br>

The twilight darkened 'round us, in the room,<br>
While Helen sang; and, in the gathering gloom,<br>
Vivian reached out, and took my hand in his,<br>
And held it so; while Helen made the air<br>
Languid with music. Then a step drew near,<br>
And voice of Aunt Ruth broke the spell:<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Dear! dear!<br>
Why Maurie, Helen, children! how is this?<br>
I hear you, but you have no light in there.<br>
Your room is dark as Egypt. What a way<br>
For folks to visit!&#8212;Maurie, go, I pray,<br>
And order lamps."<br>

And all the sweet dreams hovering around<br>
The twilight shadows flitted in affright:<br>
And e'en the music had a harsher sound.<br>

<br>

In pleasant converse passed an hour away:<br>
And Vivian planned a picnic for next day&#8212;<br>
A drive the next, and rambles without end,<br>
That he might help me entertain my friend.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 32]</span>And then he rose, bowed low, and passed from sight,<br>
Like some great star that drops out from the night;<br>
And Helen watched him through the shadows go,<br>
And turned and said, her voice subdued and low,<br>
"How tall he is! in all my life, Maurine,<br>
A grander man I never yet have seen."<br>

<blockquote><blockquote>
One golden twelfth&#8209;part of a checkered year;<br>
One summer month, of sunlight, moonlight, mirth<br>
With not a hint of shadows lurking near,<br>
Or storm&#8209;clouds brewing.<br>

<br>

Voluptuous July held her lover, Earth,<br>
With her warm arms, upon her glowing breast,<br>
And twined herself about him, as he lay<br>
Smiling and panting in his dream&#8209;stirred rest.<br>
She bound him with her limbs of perfect grace,<br>
And hid him with her trailing robe of green,<br>
And wound him in her long hair's shimmering sheen,<br>
And rained her ardent kisses on his face.<br>

<br>

Through the glad glory of the summer land<br>
Helen and I went wandering, hand in hand.<br>
In winding paths, hard by the ripe wheat&#8209;field,<br>
White with the promise of a bounteous yield,<br>
Across the late shorn meadow&#8212;down the hill,<br>
Red with the tiger&#8209;lily blossoms, till<br>
We stood upon the borders of the lake,<br>
That like a pretty, placid infant, slept<br>
Low at its base: and little ripples crept<br>
Along its surface, just as dimples chase<br>
Each other o'er an infant's sleeping face<br>

<br>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 34]</span>Helen in idle hours had learned to make<br>
A thousand pretty, feminine knick&#8209;knacks:<br>
For brackets, ottomans, and toilet stands&#8212;<br>
Labor just suited to her dainty hands.<br>
That morning she had been at work in wax,<br>
Molding a wreath of flowers for my room,&#8212;<br>
Taking her patterns from the living blows,<br>
In all their dewy beauty and sweet bloom,<br>
Fresh from my garden. Fuchsia, tulip, rose,<br>
And trailing ivy, grew beneath her touch,<br>
Resembling the living plants as much<br>
As life is copied in the form of death:<br>
These lacking but the perfume, and that, breath.<br>

<br>

And now the wreath was all completed, save<br>
The mermaid blossom of all flowerdom,<br>
A water&#8209;lily, dripping from the wave.<br>
And 'twas in search of it that we had come<br>
Down to the lake, and wandered on the beach,<br>
To see if any lilies grew in reach.<br>
Some broken stalks, where flowers late had been;<br>
Some buds, with all their beauties folded in,<br>
We found, but not the treasure that we sought<br>
And then we turned our footsteps to the spot<br>
Where, all impatient of its chain, my boat,<br>
"The Swan," rocked, asking to be set afloat<br>
It was a dainty row&#8209;boat&#8212;strong, yet light;<br>
Each side a swan was painted snowy white:<br>
A present from my uncle, just before<br>
He sailed, with Death, to that mysterious strand,<br>
Where freighted ships go sailing evermore,<br>
But none return to tell us of the land.<br>

<br>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 35]</span>I freed the "Swan," and slowly rowed about,<br>
Wherever sea&#8209;weeds, grass, or green leaves lifted<br>
Their tips above the water. So we drifted,<br>
While Helen, opposite, leaned idly out<br>
And watched for lilies in the waves below,<br>
And softly crooned some sweet and dreamy air,<br>
That soothed me like a mother's lullabies.<br>
I dropped the oars, and closed my sun&#8209;kissed eyes,<br>
And let the boat go drifting here and there.<br>
Oh, happy day! the last of that brief time<br>
Of thoughtless youth, when all the world seems bright,<br>
Ere that disguis&#232;d angel men call Woe<br>
Leads the sad heart through valleys dark as night,<br>
Up to the heights exalted and sublime.<br>
On each blest, happy moment, I am fain<br>
To linger long, ere I pass on to pain<br>
And sorrow that succeeded.<br>

<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From day&#8209;dreams,<br>
As golden as the summer noontide's beams,<br>
I was awakened by a voice that cried:<br>
"Strange ship, ahoy! Fair frigate, whither bound?"<br>
And, starting up, I cast my gaze around,<br>
And saw a sail&#8209;boat o'er the water glide<br>
Close to the "Swan," like some live thing of grace;<br>
And from it looked the glowing, handsome face<br>
Of Vivian.<br>

<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Beauteous sirens of the sea,<br>
Come sail across the raging main with me!"<br>
He laughed; and leaning, drew our drifting boat<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 36]</span>Beside his own. "There, now! step in!" he said,<br>
"I'll land you anywhere you want to go&#8212;<br>
My boat is safer far than yours, I know:<br>
And much more pleasant with its sails all spread.<br>
The Swan? We'll take the oars, and let it float<br>
Ashore at leisure. You, Maurine, sit there&#8212;<br>
Miss Helen here. Ye gods and little fishes!<br>
I've reached the height of pleasure, and my wishes.<br>
Adieu despondency! farewell to care!"<br>

<br>

'T was done so quickly: that was Vivian's way.<br>
He did not wait for either yea or nay.<br>
He gave commands, and left you with no choice<br>
But just to do the bidding of his voice.<br>
His rare, kind smile, low tones, and manly face<br>
Lent to his quick imperiousness a grace<br>
And winning charm, completely stripping it<br>
Of what might otherwise have seemed unfit.<br>
Leaving no trace of tyranny, but just<br>
That nameless force that seemed to say, "You must."<br>
Suiting its pretty title of "The Dawn,"<br>
(So named, he said, that it might rhyme with "Swan,")<br>
Vivian's sail&#8209;boat, was carpeted with blue,<br>
While all its sails were of a pale rose hue.<br>
The daintiest craft that flirted with the breeze;<br>
A poet's fancy in an hour of ease.<br>

<br>

Whatever Vivian had was of the best.<br>
His room was like some Sultan's in the East.<br>
His board was always spread as for a feast.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 37]</span>Whereat, each meal, he was both host and guest.<br>
He would go hungry sooner than he'd dine<br>
At his own table if 'twere illy set.<br>
He so loved things artistic in design&#8212;<br>
Order and beauty, all about him. Yet<br>
So kind he was, if it befell his lot<br>
To dine within the humble peasant's cot,<br>
He made it seem his native soil to be,<br>
And thus displayed the true gentility.<br>

<br>

Under the rosy banners of the "Dawn,"<br>
Around the lake we drifted on, and on.<br>
It was a time for dreams, and not for speech.<br>
And so we floated on in silence, each<br>
Weaving the fancies suiting such a day.<br>
Helen leaned idly o'er the sail&#8209;boat's side,<br>
And dipped her rosy fingers in the tide;<br>
And I among the cushions half reclined,<br>
Half sat, and watched the fleecy clouds at play<br>
While Vivian with his blank&#8209;book, opposite,<br>
In which he seemed to either sketch or write<br>
Was lost in inspiration of some kind.<br>

<br>

No time, no change, no scene, can e'er efface<br>
My mind's impression of that hour and place;<br>
It stands out like a picture. O'er the years,<br>
Black with their robes of sorrow&#8212;veiled with tears,<br>
Lying with all their lengthened shapes between,<br>
Untouched, undimmed, I still behold that scene.<br>
Just as the last of Indian&#8209;summer days,<br>
Replete with sunlight, crowned with amber haze,<br>
Followed by dark and desolate December,<br>
Through all the months of winter we remember.<br>

<br>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 38]</span>The sun slipped westward. That peculiar change<br>
Which creeps into the air, and speaks of night<br>
While yet the day is full of golden light,<br>
We felt steal o'er us.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Vivian broke the spell<br>
Of dream&#8209;fraught silence, throwing down his book:<br>
"Young ladies, please allow me to arrange<br>
These wraps about your shoulders. I know well<br>
The fickle nature of our atmosphere,&#8212;<br>
Her smile swift followed by a frown or tear,&#8212;<br>
And go prepared for changes. Now you look,<br>
Like&#8212;like&#8212;oh, where's a pretty simile?<br>
Had you a pocket mirror here you'd see<br>
How well my native talent is displayed<br>
In shawling you. Red on the brunette maid;<br>
Blue on the blonde&#8212;and quite without design<br>
(Oh, where <i>is</i> that comparison of mine?)<br>
Well&#8212;like a June rose and a violet blue<br>
In one bouquet! I fancy that will do.<br>
And now I crave your patience and a boon,<br>
Which is to listen, while I read my rhyme,<br>
A floating fancy of the summer time.<br>
'Tis neither witty, wonderful, nor wise,<br>
So listen kindly&#8212;but don't criticise<br>
My maiden effort of the afternoon:<br>

<blockquote>
"If all the ships I have at sea<br>
&#160;Should come a&#8209;sailing home to me,<br>
&#160;Ah, well! the harbor could not hold<br>
&#160;So many sails as there would be<br>
&#160;If all my ships came in from sea.<br>

<br>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 39]</span>"If half my ships came home from sea,<br>
&#160;And brought their precious freight to me,<br>
&#160;Ah, well! I should have wealth as great<br>
&#160;As any king who sits in state&#8212;<br>
&#160;So rich the treasures that would be<br>
&#160;In half my ships now out at sea.<br>

<br>

"If just one ship I have at sea<br>
&#160;Should come a&#8209;sailing home to me,<br>
&#160;Ah, well! the storm&#8209;clouds then might frown:<br>
&#160;For if the others all went down<br>
&#160;Still rich and proud and glad I'd be,<br>
&#160;If that one ship came back to me.<br>

<br>

"If that one ship went down at sea,<br>
&#160;And all the others came to me,<br>
&#160;Weighed down with gems and wealth untold,<br>
&#160;With glory, honor, riches, gold,<br>
&#160;The poorest soul on earth I'd be<br>
&#160;If that one ship came not to me.<br>

<br>

"O skies be calm? O winds blow free&#8212;<br>
&#160;Blow all my ships safe home to me.<br>
&#160;But if thou sendest some a&#8209;wrack<br>
&#160;To never more come sailing back,<br>
&#160;Send any&#8212;all, that skim the sea,<br>
&#160;But bring my love&#8209;ship home to me."<br>
</blockquote>

Helen was leaning by me, and her head<br>
Rested against my shoulder: as he read,<br>
I stroked her hair, and watched the fleecy skies,<br>
And when he finished, did not turn my eyes.<br>
I felt too happy and too shy to meet<br>
His gaze just then. I said, "'Tis very sweet,<br>
And suits the day; does it not, Helen, dear?"<br>
But Helen, voiceless, did not seem to hear.<br>
"'Tis strange," I added, "how you poets sing<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 40]</span>So feelingly about the very thing<br>
You care not for! and dress up an ideal<br>
So well, it looks a living, breathing real!<br>
Now, to a listener, your love song seemed<br>
A heart's out&#8209;pouring; yet I've heard you say<br>
Almost the opposite; or that you deemed<br>
Position, honor, glory, power, fame,<br>
Gained without loss of conscience or good name,<br>
The things to live for."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Have you? Well you may,"<br>
Laughed Vivian, "but 'twas years&#8212;or months ago!<br>
And Solomon says wise men change, you know!<br>
I now speak truth! if she I hold most dear<br>
Slipped from my life, and no least hope were left,<br>
My heart would find the years more lonely here.<br>
Than if I were of wealth, fame, friends, bereft,<br>
And sent an exile to a foreign land."<br>

<br>

His voice was low, and measured: as he spoke,<br>
New, unknown chords of melody awoke<br>
Within my soul. I felt my heart expand<br>
With that sweet fullness born of love. I turned<br>
To hide the blushes on my cheek that burned,<br>
And leaning over Helen, breathed her name.<br>
She lay so motionless I thought she slept:<br>
But, as I spoke, I saw her eyes unclose,<br>
And o'er her face a sudden glory swept,<br>
And a slight tremor thrilled all through her frame.<br>
"Sweet friend," I said, "your face is full of light:<br>
What were the dreams that made your eyes so bright?"<br>

<br>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 41]</span>She only smiled for answer, and arose<br>
From her reclining posture at my side,<br>
Threw back the clust'ring ringlets from her face<br>
With a quick gesture, full of easy grace,<br>
And, turning, spoke to Vivian. "Will you guide<br>
The boat up near that little clump of green<br>
Off to the right? There's where the lilies grow.<br>
We quite forgot our errand here, Maurine,<br>
And our few moments have grown into hours.<br>
What will Aunt Ruth think of our ling'ring so?<br>
There&#8212;that will do&#8212;now I can reach the flowers."<br>

<br>

"Hark! just hear that!" and Vivian broke forth singing,<br>
"Row, brothers, row." "The six o'clock bell's ringing!<br>
Who ever knew three hours to go so fast<br>
In all the annals of the world, before?<br>
I could have sworn not over one had passed.<br>
Young ladies, I am forced to go ashore!<br>
I thank you for the pleasure you have given;<br>
This afternoon has been a glimpse of heaven.<br>
Good night&#8212;sweet dreams! and by your gracious leave,<br>
I'll pay my compliments to&#8209;morrow eve."<br>

<br>

A smile, a bow, and he had gone his way:<br>
And, in the waning glory of the day,<br>
Down cool, green lanes, and through the length'ning shadows,<br>
Silent, we wandered back across the meadows.<br>
The wreath was finished, and adorned my room;<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 42]</span>Long afterward, the lilies' copied bloom<br>
Was like a horrid specter in my sight,<br>
Staring upon me morning, noon, and night.<br>

<br>

The sun went down. The sad new moon rose up,<br>
And passed before me, like an empty cup,<br>
The Great Unseen brims full of pain or bliss,<br>
And gives His children, saying, "Drink of this."<br>

<br>

A light wind, from the open casement, fanned<br>
My brow and Helen's, as we, hand in hand,<br>
Sat looking out upon the twilight scene,<br>
In dreamy silence. Helen's dark blue eyes,<br>
Like two lost stars that wandered from the skies<br>
Some night adown the meteor's shining track,<br>
And always had been grieving to go back,<br>
Now gazed up, wistfully, at heaven's dome,<br>
And seemed to recognize and long for home.<br>
Her sweet voice broke the silence: "Wish, Maurine,<br>
Before you speak! you know the moon is new,<br>
And anything you wish for will come true<br>
Before it wanes. I do believe the sign!<br>
Now tell me your wish, and I'll tell you mine."<br>

<br>

I turned and looked up at the slim young moon;<br>
And, with an almost superstitious heart,<br>
I sighed, "Oh, new moon! help me, by thine art,<br>
To grow all grace and goodness, and to be<br>
Worthy the love a true heart proffers me."<br>
Then smiling down, I said, "Dear one! my boon,<br>
I fear, is quite too silly or too sweet<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 43]</span>For my repeating: so we'll let it stay<br>
Between the moon and me. But if I may<br>
I'll listen now to your wish. Tell me, please!"<br>

<br>

All suddenly she nestled at my feet,<br>
And hid her blushing face upon my knees.<br>
Then drew my hand against her glowing cheek,<br>
And, leaning on my breast, began to speak,<br>
Half sighing out the words my tortured ear<br>
Reached down to catch, while striving not to hear.<br>

<br>

"Can you not guess who 'twas about, Maurine?<br>
Oh, my sweet friend! you must ere this have seen<br>
The love I tried to cover from all eyes<br>
And from myself. Ah, foolish little heart!<br>
As well it might go seeking for some art<br>
Whereby to hide the sun in noonday skies.<br>
When first the strange sound of his voice I heard,<br>
Looked on his noble face, and touched his hand,<br>
My slumb'ring heart thrilled through and through, and stirred<br>
As if to say, 'I hear, and understand.'<br>
And day by day mine eyes were blest beholding<br>
The inner beauty of his life, unfolding<br>
In countless words and actions, that portrayed<br>
The noble stuff of which his soul was made.<br>
And more and more I felt my heart upreaching<br>
Toward the truth, drawn gently by his teaching,<br>
As flowers are drawn by sunlight. And there grew<br>
A strange, shy something in its depths, I knew<br>
At length was love, because it was so sad,<br>
And yet so sweet, and made my heart so glad,<br>

<br>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 44]</span>Yet seemed to pain me. Then, for very shame,<br>
Lest all should read my secret and its name.<br>
I strove to hide it in my breast away,<br>
Where God could see it only. But each day<br>
It seemed to grow within me, and would rise,<br>
Like my own soul, and look forth from my eyes,<br>
Defying bonds of silence; and would speak,<br>
In its red&#8209;lettered language, on my cheek,<br>
If but his name was uttered. You were kind,<br>
My own Maurine! as you alone could be,<br>
So long the sharer of my heart and mind,<br>
While yet you saw, in seeming not to see.<br>
In all the years we have been friends, my own.<br>
And loved as women very rarely do,<br>
My heart no sorrow and no joy has known<br>
It has not shared at once, in full, with you<br>
And I so longed to speak to you of this,<br>
When first I felt its mingled pain and bliss;<br>
Yet dared not, lest you, knowing him, should say,<br>
In pity for my folly&#8212;'Lack&#8209;a&#8209;day!<br>
You are undone: because no mortal art<br>
Can win the love of such a lofty heart.'<br>
And so I waited, silent and in pain,<br>
Till I could know I did not love in vain.<br>
And now I know, beyond a doubt or fear.<br>
Did he not say, 'If she I hold most dear<br>
Slipped from my life, and no least hope were left,<br>
My heart would find the years more lonely here<br>
Than if I were of wealth, fame, friends, bereft,<br>
And sent, an exile, to a foreign land'?<br>
Oh, darling, you must <i>love</i>, to understand<br>
The joy that thrilled all through me at those words.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 45]</span>It was as if a thousand singing birds<br>
Within my heart broke forth in notes of praise.<br>
I did not look up, but I knew his gaze<br>
Was on my face, and that his eyes must see<br>
The joy I felt almost transfigured me.<br>
He loves me&#8212;loves me! so the birds kept singing,<br>
And all my soul with that sweet strain is ringing.<br>
If there were added but one drop of bliss,<br>
No more my cup would hold: and so, this eve,<br>
I made a wish that I might feel his kiss<br>
Upon my lips, ere yon pale moon should leave<br>
The stars all lonely, having waned away,<br>
Too old and weak and bowed with care to stay."<br>

<br>

Her voice sighed into silence. While she spoke<br>
My heart writhed in me, praying she would cease&#8212;<br>
Each word she uttered falling like a stroke<br>
On my bare soul. And now a hush like death,<br>
Save that 'twas broken by a quick&#8209;drawn breath,<br>
Fell 'round me, but brought not the hoped&#8209;for peace.<br>
For when the lash no longer leaves its blows,<br>
The flesh still quivers, and the blood still flows.<br>

<br>

She nestled on my bosom like a child.<br>
And 'neath her head my tortured heart throbbed wild<br>
With pain and pity. She had told her tale&#8212;<br>
Her self&#8209;deceiving story to the end.<br>
How could I look down on her as she lay<br>
So fair, and sweet, and lily&#8209;like, and frail&#8212;<br>
A tender blossom on my breast, and say,<br>
"Nay, you are wrong&#8212;you do mistake, dear friend!<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 46]</span>'Tis I am loved, not you"? Yet that were truth,<br>
And she must know it later.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Should I speak,<br>
And spread a ghastly pallor o'er the cheek<br>
Flushed now with joy?&#8212;And while I, doubting, pondered,<br>
She spoke again. "Maurine! I oft have wondered<br>
Why you and Vivian were not lovers. He<br>
Is all a heart could ask its king to be;<br>
And you have beauty, intellect and youth.<br>
I think it strange you have not loved each other&#8212;<br>
Strange how he could pass by you for another<br>
Not half so fair or worthy. Yet I know<br>
A loving Father pre&#8209;arranged it so.<br>
I think my heart has known him all these years,<br>
And waited for him. And if when he came<br>
It had been as a lover of my friend,<br>
I should have recognized him, all the same,<br>
As my soul&#8209;mate, and loved him to the end,<br>
Hiding my grief, and forcing back my tears<br>
Till on my heart, slow dropping, day by day,<br>
Unseen they fell, and wore it all away.<br>
And so a tender Father kept him free,<br>
With all the largeness of his love, for me&#8212;<br>
For me, unworthy such a precious gift!<br>
Yet I will bend each effort of my life<br>
To grow in grace and goodness, and to lift<br>
My soul and spirit to his lofty height,<br>
So to deserve that holy name, his wife.<br>
Sweet friend, it fills my whole heart with delight<br>
To breathe its long hid secret in your ear.<br>
Speak, my Maurine, and say you love to hear!"<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 47]</span>The while she spoke, my active brain gave rise<br>
To one great thought of mighty sacrifice<br>
And self&#8209;denial. Oh! it blanched my cheek,<br>
And wrung my soul; and from my heart it drove<br>
All life and feeling. Coward&#8209;like, I strove<br>
To send it from me; but I felt it cling<br>
And hold fast on my mind like some live thing;<br>
And all the Self within me felt its touch<br>
And cried, "No, no! I cannot do so much&#8212;<br>
I am not strong enough&#8212;there is no call."<br>
And then the voice of Helen bade me speak,<br>
And with a calmness born of nerve, I said,<br>
Scarce knowing what I uttered, "Sweetheart, all<br>
Your joys and sorrows are with mine own wed.<br>
I thank you for your confidence, and pray<br>
I may deserve it always. But, dear one,<br>
Something&#8212;perhaps our boat&#8209;ride in the sun,<br>
Has set my head to aching. I must go<br>
To bed directly; and you will, I know,<br>
Grant me your pardon, and another day<br>
We'll talk of this together. Now good night<br>
And angels guard you with their wings of light."<br>

<br>

I kissed her lips, and held her on my heart,<br>
And viewed her as I ne'er had done before.<br>
I gazed upon her features o'er and o'er;<br>
Marked her white, tender face&#8212;her fragile form,<br>
Like some frail plant that withers in the storm;<br>
Saw she was fairer in her new&#8209;found joy<br>
Than e'er before; and thought, "Can I destroy<br>
God's handiwork, or leave it at the best<br>
A broken harp, while I close clasp my bliss?"<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 48]</span>I bent my head and gave her one last kiss,<br>
And sought my room, and found there such relief<br>
As sad hearts feel when first alone with grief.<br>

<br>

The moon went down, slow sailing from my sight,<br>
And left the stars to watch away the night.<br>
O stars, sweet stars, so changeless and serene!<br>
What depths of woe your pitying eyes have seen!<br>
The proud sun sets, and leaves us with our sorrow,<br>
To grope alone in darkness till the morrow.<br>
The languid moon, e'en if she deigns to rise,<br>
Soon seeks her couch, grown weary of our sighs;<br>
But from the early gloaming till the day<br>
Sends golden&#8209;liveried heralds forth to say<br>
He comes in might; the patient stars shine on,<br>
Steadfast and faithful, from twilight to dawn.<br>
And, as they shone upon Gethsemane,<br>
And watched the struggle of a God&#8209;like soul,<br>
Now from the same far height they shone on me,<br>
And saw the waves of anguish o'er me roll.<br>

<br>

The storm had come upon me all unseen:<br>
No sound of thunder fell upon my ear;<br>
No cloud arose to tell me it was near;<br>
But under skies all sunlit, and serene,<br>
I floated with the current of the stream,<br>
And thought life all one golden&#8209;haloed dream.<br>
When lo! a hurricane, with awful force,<br>
Swept swift upon its devastating course,<br>
Wrecked my frail bark, and cast me on the wave<br>
Where all my hopes had found a sudden grave.<br>
Love makes us blind and selfish: otherwise<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 49]</span>I had seen Helen's secret in her eyes;<br>
So used I was to reading every look<br>
In her sweet face, as I would read a book.<br>
But now, made sightless by love's blinding rays,<br>
I had gone on unseeing, to the end<br>
Where Pain dispelled the mist of golden haze<br>
That walled me in, and lo! I found my friend<br>
Who journeyed with me&#8212;at my very side,<br>
Had been sore wounded to the heart, while I<br>
Both deaf and blind, saw not, nor heard her cry.<br>
And then I sobbed, "O God! I would have died<br>
To save her this." And as I cried in pain,<br>
There leaped forth from the still, white realm of Thought<br>
Where Conscience dwells, that unimpassioned spot<br>
As widely different from the heart's domain<br>
As north from south&#8212;the impulse felt before,<br>
And put away; but now it rose once more,<br>
In greater strength, and said, "Heart, would'st thou prove<br>
What lips have uttered? Then go lay thy love<br>
On Friendship's altar, as thy offering."<br>
"Nay!" cried my heart, "ask any other thing&#8212;<br>
Ask life itself&#8212;'twere easier sacrifice.<br>
But ask not love, for that I cannot give."<br>

<br>

"But," spoke the voice, "the meanest insect dies,<br>
And is no hero! heroes dare to live<br>
When all that makes life sweet is snatched away."<br>
So with my heart, in converse, till the day<br>
In gold and crimson billows, rose and broke,<br>
The voice of Conscience, all unwearied, spoke.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 50]</span>Love warred with Friendship: heart with Conscience fought,<br>
Hours rolled away, and yet the end was not.<br>
And wily Self, tricked out like tenderness,<br>
Sighed, "Think how one, whose life thou wert to bless,<br>
Will be cast down, and grope in doubt and fear!<br>
Wouldst thou wound him, to give thy friend relief?<br>
Can wrong make right?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Nay!" Conscience said, "but Pride<br>
And Time can heal the saddest hurts of Love.<br>
While Friendship's wounds gape wide and yet more wide,<br>
And bitter fountains of the spirit prove."<br>

<br>

At length, exhausted with the wearing strife,<br>
I cast the new&#8209;found burden of my life<br>
On God's broad breast, and sought that deep repose<br>
That only he who watched with sorrow knows.<br>

<blockquote><blockquote>
"Maurine, Maurine! 'tis ten o'clock! arise,<br>
My pretty sluggard! open those dark eyes,<br>
And see where yonder sun is! Do you know<br>
I made my toilet just four hours ago?"<br>

<br>

'T was Helen's voice: and Helen's gentle kiss<br>
Fell on my cheek. As from a deep abyss,<br>
I drew my weary self from that strange sleep<br>
That rests not, nor refreshes. Scarce awake<br>
Or conscious, yet there seemed a heavy weight<br>
Bound on my breast, as by a cruel Fate.<br>
I knew not why, and yet I longed to weep.<br>
Some dark cloud seemed to hang upon the day;<br>
And, for a moment, in that trance I lay,<br>
When suddenly the truth did o'er me break,<br>
Like some great wave upon a helpless child.<br>
The dull pain in my breast grew like a knife&#8212;<br>
The heavy throbbing of my heart grew wild,<br>
And God gave back the burden of the life<br>
He kept what time I slumbered.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You are ill,"<br>
Cried Helen, "with that blinding headache still!<br>
You look so pale and weary. Now let me<br>
Play nurse, Maurine, and care for you to&#8209;day!<br>
And first I'll suit some dainty to your taste,<br>
And bring it to you, with a cup of tea."<br>
And off she ran, not waiting my reply.<br>
But, wanting most the sunshine and the light,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 52]</span>I left my couch, and clothed myself in haste,<br>
And, kneeling, sent to God an earnest cry<br>
For help and guidance.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Show Thou me the way,<br>
Where duty leads; for I am blind! my sight<br>
Obscured by self. Oh, lead my steps aright!<br>
Help me see the path: and if it may,<br>
Let this cup pass:&#8212;and yet Thou heavenly One<br>
Thy will in all things, not mine own, be done."<br>
Rising, I went upon my way, receiving<br>
The strength prayer gives alway to hearts believing.<br>
I felt that unseen hands were leading me,<br>
And knew the end was peace.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What! are you up?"<br>
Cried Helen, coming with a tray, and cup,<br>
Of tender toast, and fragrant smoking tea.<br>
"You naughty girl! you should have stayed in bed<br>
Until you ate your breakfast, and were better<br>
I've something hidden for you here&#8212;a letter.<br>
But drink your tea before you read it, dear!<br>
'Tis from some distant cousin, Auntie said,<br>
And so you need not hurry. Now be good,<br>
And mind your Helen."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So, in passive mood,<br>
I laid the still unopened letter near,<br>
And loitered at my breakfast more to please<br>
My nurse, than any hunger to appease.<br>
Then listlessly I broke the seal and read<br>
The few lines written in a bold free hand:<br>
"New London, Canada. Dear Coz. Maurine!<br>
(In spite of generations stretched between<br>
Our natural right to that most handy claim<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 53]</span>Of cousinship, we'll use it all the same)<br>
I'm coming to see you! honestly, in truth!<br>
I've threatened often&#8212;now I mean to act.<br>
You'll find my coming is a stubborn fact.<br>
Keep quiet though, and do not tell Aunt Ruth<br>
I wonder if she'll know her petted boy<br>
In spite of changes. Look for me until<br>
You see me coming. As of old I'm still<br>
Your faithful friend, and loving cousin, Roy."<br>

<br>

So Roy was coming! He and I had played<br>
As boy and girl, and later, youth and maid,<br>
Full half our lives together. He had been,<br>
Like me, an orphan; and the roof of kin<br>
Gave both kind shelter. Swift years sped away<br>
Ere change was felt: and then one summer day<br>
A long lost uncle sailed from India's shore&#8212;<br>
Made Roy his heir, and he was ours no more.<br>

<br>

"He'd write us daily, and we'd see his face<br>
Once every year." Such was his promise given<br>
The morn he left. But now the years were seven<br>
Since last he looked upon the olden place.<br>
He'd been through college, traveled in all lands,<br>
Sailed over seas, and trod the desert sands.<br>
Would write and plan a visit, then, ere long,<br>
Would write again from Egypt or Hong Kong&#8212;<br>
Some fancy called him thither unforeseen.<br>
So years had passed, till seven lay between<br>
His going and the coming of this note,<br>
Which I hid in my bosom, and replied<br>
To Aunt Ruth's queries, "What the truant wrote?"<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 54]</span>By saying he was still upon the wing,<br>
And merely dropped a line, while journeying,<br>
To say he lived: and she was satisfied.<br>

<br>

Sometimes it happens, in this world so strange,<br>
A human heart will pass through mortal strife,<br>
And writhe in torture: while the old sweet life<br>
So full of hope, and beauty, bloom and grace,<br>
Is slowly strangled by remorseless Pain:<br>
And one stern, cold, relentless, takes its place&#8212;<br>
A ghastly, pallid specter of the slain.<br>
Yet those in daily converse see no change<br>
Nor dream the heart has suffered.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So that day<br>
I passed along toward the troubled way<br>
Stern duty pointed, and no mortal guessed<br>
A mighty conflict had disturbed my breast.<br>

<br>

I had resolved to yield up to my friend<br>
The man I loved. Since she, too, loved him so<br>
I saw no other way in honor left.<br>
She was so weak and fragile, once bereft<br>
Of this great hope, that held her with such power<br>
She would wilt down, like some frost&#8209;bitten flower<br>
And swift untimely death would be the end.<br>
But I was strong: and hardy plants, which grow<br>
In out&#8209;door soil, can bear bleak winds that blow<br>
From Arctic lands, whereof a single breath<br>
Would lay the hot&#8209;house blossom low in death.<br>

<br>

The hours went by, too slow, and yet too fast.<br>
All day I argued with my foolish heart<br>
That bade me play the shrinking coward's part<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 55]</span>And hide from pain. And when the day had past<br>
And time for Vivian's call drew near and nearer,<br>
It pleaded. "Wait, until the way seems clearer:<br>
Say you are ill&#8212;or busy: keep away<br>
Until you gather strength enough to play<br>
The part you have resolved on."<br>

<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Nay, not so,"<br>
Made answer clear&#8209;eyed Reason, "Do you go<br>
And put your resolution to the test.<br>
Resolve, however nobly formed, at best<br>
Is but a still born babe of Thought, until<br>
It proves existence of its life and will<br>
By sound or action."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So when Helen came<br>
And knelt by me, her fair face all aflame<br>
With sudden blushes, whispering, "My sweet!<br>
My heart can hear the music of his feet&#8212;<br>
Go down with me to meet him," I arose,<br>
And went with her all calmly, as one goes<br>
To look upon the dear face of the dead.<br>

<br>

That eve, I know not what I did or said.<br>
I was not cold&#8212;my manner was not strange:<br>
Perchance I talked more freely than my wont,<br>
But in my speech was naught could give affront;<br>
Yet I conveyed, as only woman can,<br>
That nameless <i>something</i>, which bespeaks a change.<br>

<br>

'Tis in the power of woman, if she be<br>
Whole&#8209;souled and noble, free from coquetry&#8212;<br>
Her motives all unselfish, worthy, good,<br>
To make herself and feelings understood<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 56]</span>By nameless acts&#8212;thus sparing what to man,<br>
However gently answered, causes pain,<br>
The offering of his hand and heart in vain.<br>

<br>

She can be friendly, unrestrained, and kind,<br>
Assume no airs of pride or arrogance;<br>
But in her voice, her manner, and her glance,<br>
Convey that mystic something, undefined,<br>
Which men fail not to understand and read,<br>
And, when not blind with egoism, heed.<br>
My task was harder. 'T was the slow undoing<br>
Of long sweet months of unimpeded wooing.<br>
It was to hide and cover and conceal<br>
The truth&#8212;assuming, what I did not feel.<br>
It was to dam love's happy singing tide<br>
That blessed me with its hopeful, tuneful tone,<br>
By feigned indiff'rence, till it turned aside,<br>
And changed its channel, leaving me alone<br>
To walk parched plains, and thirst for that sweet draught<br>
My lips had tasted, but another quaffed.<br>
It could be done. For no words yet were spoken&#8212;<br>
None to recall&#8212;no pledges to be broken.<br>
"He will be grieved, then angry, cold, then cross,"<br>
I reasoned, thinking what would be his part<br>
In this strange drama. "Then, because his he<br>
Feels something lacking, to make good his loss,<br>
He'll turn to Helen: and her gentle grace<br>
And loving acts will win her soon the place<br>
I hold to&#8209;day: and like a troubled dream<br>
At length, our past, when he looks back, will seem."<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 57]</span>That evening passed with music, chat and song:<br>
But hours that once had flown on airy wings<br>
Now limped on weary, aching limbs along,<br>
Each moment like some dreaded step that brings<br>
A twinge of pain.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As Vivian rose to go,<br>
Slow bending to me, from his greater height,<br>
He took my hand, and, looking in my eyes,<br>
With tender questioning and pained surprise,<br>
Said, "Maurine, you are not yourself to&#8209;night!<br>
What is it? Are you ailing?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ailing? no,"<br>
I answered, laughing lightly, "I am not:<br>
Just see my cheek, sir! is it thin, or pale?<br>
Now tell me, am I looking very frail?"<br>
"Nay, nay!" he answered, "it can not be <i>seen</i>,<br>
The change I speak of&#8212;'twas more in your mien:<br>
Preoccupation, or&#8212;I know not what!<br>
Miss Helen, am I wrong, or does Maurine<br>
Seem to have something on her mind this eve?"<br>
"She does!" laughed Helen, "and I do believe<br>
I know what 'tis! A letter came to&#8209;day<br>
Which she read slyly, and then hid away<br>
Close to her heart, not knowing I was near:<br>
And since she's been as you have seen her here.<br>
See how she blushes! so my random shot<br>
We must believe has struck a tender spot."<br>

<br>

Her rippling laughter floated through the room,<br>
And redder yet I felt the hot blood rise,<br>
Then surge away to leave me pale as death,<br>
Under the dark and swiftly gathering gloom<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 58]</span>Of Vivian's questioning, accusing eyes,<br>
That searched my soul. I almost shrieked beneath<br>
That stern, fixed gaze; and stood spellbound until<br>
He turned with sudden movement, gave his hand<br>
To each in turn, and said, "You must not stand<br>
Longer, young ladies, in this open door.<br>
The air is heavy with a cold damp chill.<br>
We shall have rain to&#8209;morrow, or before.<br>
Good night."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He vanished in the darkling shade;<br>
And so the dreaded evening found an end,<br>
That saw me grasp the conscience&#8209;whetted blade,<br>
And strike a blow for honor and for friend.<br>

<br>

"How swiftly passed the evening!" Helen sighed.<br>
"How long the hours!" my tortured heart replied.<br>
Joy, like a child, with lightsome steps doth glide<br>
By Father Time, and, looking in his face,<br>
Cries, snatching blossoms from the fair road&#8209;side,<br>
"I could pluck more, but for thy hurried pace."<br>
The while her elder brother Pain, man grown,<br>
Whose feet are hurt by many a thorn and stone,<br>
Looks to some distant hill&#8209;top, high and calm,<br>
Where he shall find not only rest, but balm<br>
For all his wounds, and cries in tones of woe,<br>
"O Father Time! why is thy pace so slow?"<br>

<br>

Two days, all sad with lonely wind and rain,<br>
Went sobbing by, repeating o'er and o'er<br>
The miserere, desolate and drear,<br>
Which every human heart must sometime hear.<br>
Pain is but little varied. Its refrain,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 59]</span>Whate'er the words are, is for aye the same.<br>
The third day brought a change: for with it came<br>
Not only sunny smiles to Nature's face,<br>
But Roy, our Roy came back to us. Once more<br>
We looked into his laughing, handsome eyes,<br>
Which, while they gave Aunt Ruth a glad surprise<br>
In no way puzzled her: for one glance told<br>
What each succeeding one confirmed, that he<br>
Who bent above her with the lissome grace<br>
Of his fine form, though grown so tall, could be<br>
No other than the Roy Montaine of old.<br>

<br>

It was a sweet reunion: and he brought<br>
So much of sunshine with him, that I caught,<br>
Just from his smile alone, enough of gladness<br>
To make my heart forget a time its sadness.<br>
We talked together of the dear old days:<br>
Leaving the present, with its depths and heights<br>
Of life's maturer sorrows and delights,<br>
I turned back to my childhood's level land,<br>
And Roy and I, dear playmates, hand in hand,<br>
Wandered in mem'ry, through the olden ways.<br>

<br>

It was the second evening of his coming.<br>
Helen was playing dreamily, and humming<br>
Some wordless melody of white&#8209;souled thought,<br>
While Roy and I sat by the open door,<br>
Re&#8209;living childish incidents of yore.<br>
My eyes were glowing, and my cheeks were hot<br>
With warm young blood; excitement, joy, or pain<br>
Alike would send swift coursing through each vein.<br>
Roy, always eloquent, was waxing fine,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 60]</span>And bringing vividly before my gaze<br>
Some old adventure of those halcyon days,<br>
When suddenly in pauses of the talk,<br>
I heard a well&#8209;known step upon the walk,<br>
And looked up quickly to meet full in mine<br>
The eyes of Vivian Dangerfield. A flash<br>
Shot from their depths:&#8212;a sudden blaze of light<br>
Like that swift followed by the thunder's crash,<br>
Which said, "Suspicion is confirmed by sight,"<br>
As they fell on the pleasant door&#8209;way scene.<br>
Then o'er his clear&#8209;cut face, a cold white look<br>
Crept, like the pallid moonlight o'er a brook,<br>
And, with a slight, proud bending of the head,<br>
He stepped toward us haughtily and said,<br>
"Please pardon my intrusion, Miss Maurine:<br>
I called to ask Miss Trevor for a book<br>
She spoke of lending me: nay, sit you still!<br>
And I, by grant of your permission, will<br>
Pass by to where I hear her playing."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Stay!"<br>
I said, "one moment, Vivian, if you please;"<br>
And suddenly bereft of all my ease,<br>
And scarcely knowing what to do, or say,<br>
Confused as any school&#8209;girl, I arose,<br>
And some way made each to the other known<br>
They bowed, shook hands: then Vivian turned away<br>
And sought out Helen, leaving us alone.<br>

<br>

"One of Miss Trevor's, or of Maurine's beaux?<br>
Which may he be, who cometh like a prince<br>
With haughty bearing, and an eagle eye?"<br>
Roy queried, laughing: and I answered, "Since<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 61]</span>You saw him pass me for Miss Trevor's side,<br>
I leave your own good judgment to reply."<br>

<br>

And straightway caused the tide of talk to glide<br>
In other channels, striving to dispel<br>
The sudden gloom that o'er my spirit fell.<br>

<br>

We mortals are such hypocrites at best!<br>
When Conscience tries our courage with a test,<br>
And points to some steep pathway, we set out<br>
Boldly, denying any fear or doubt;<br>
But pause before the first rock in the way,<br>
And, looking back, with tears, at Conscience, say<br>
"We are so sad, dear Conscience! for we would<br>
Most gladly do what to thee seemeth good;<br>
But lo! this rock! we cannot climb it, so<br>
Thou must point out some other way to go."<br>
Yet secretly we are rejoicing: and,<br>
When right before our faces, as we stand<br>
In seeming grief, the rock is cleft in twain,<br>
Leaving the pathway clear, we shrink in pain!<br>
And loth to go, by every act reveal<br>
What we so tried from Conscience to conceal.<br>

<br>

I saw that hour, the way made plain, to do<br>
With scarce an effort, what had seemed a strife<br>
That would require the strength of my whole life.<br>

<br>

Women have quick perceptions: and I knew<br>
That Vivian's heart was full of jealous pain,<br>
Suspecting&#8212;nay <i>believing</i> Roy Montaine<br>
To be my lover.&#8212;First my altered mien&#8212;<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 62]</span>And next the letter&#8212;then the door&#8209;way scene&#8212;<br>
My flushed face gazing in the one above<br>
That bent so near me, and my strange confusion<br>
When Vivian came, all led to one conclusion:<br>
That I had but been playing with his love,<br>
As women sometimes cruelly do play<br>
With hearts when their true lovers are away.<br>

<br>

There could be nothing easier, than just<br>
To let him linger on in this belief<br>
Till hourly&#8209;fed Suspicion and Distrust<br>
Should turn to scorn and anger all his grief.<br>
Compared with me, so doubly sweet and pure<br>
Would Helen seem, my purpose would be sure,<br>
And certain of completion in the end.<br>
But now, the way was made so straight and clear,<br>
My coward heart shrank back in guilty fear,<br>
Till Conscience whispered with her "still small voice,"<br>
"The precious time is passing&#8212;make thy choice&#8212;<br>
Resign thy love, or slay thy trusting friend."<br>

<br>

The growing moon, watched by the myriad eyes<br>
Of countless stars, went sailing through the skies,<br>
Like some young prince, rising to rule a nation,<br>
To whom all eyes are turned in expectation.<br>
A woman who possesses tact and art<br>
And strength of will can take the hand of doom,<br>
And walk on, smiling sweetly as she goes,<br>
With rosy lips, and rounded cheeks of bloom,<br>
Cheating a loud&#8209;tongued world that never knows<br>
The pain and sorrow of her hidden heart.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 63]</span>And so I joined in Roy's bright changing chat;<br>
Answered his sallies&#8212;talked of this and that,<br>
My brow unruffled as the calm still wave<br>
That tells not of the wrecked ship, and the grave<br>
Beneath its surface.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then we heard, ere long,<br>
The sound of Helen's gentle voice in song,<br>
And, rising, entered where the subtle power<br>
Of Vivian's eyes, forgiving while accusing,<br>
Finding me weak, had won me, in that hour;<br>
But Roy, alway polite and debonair<br>
Where ladies were, now hung about my chair<br>
With nameless delicate attentions, using<br>
That air devotional, and those small arts<br>
Acquaintance with society imparts<br>
To men gallant by nature.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;'T was my sex<br>
And not myself he bowed to. Had my place<br>
Been filled that evening by a dowager,<br>
Twice his own age, he would have given her<br>
The same attentions. But they served to vex<br>
Whatever hope in Vivian's heart remained.<br>
The cold, white look crept back upon his face,<br>
Which told how deeply he was hurt and pained.<br>

<br>

Little by little all things had conspired,<br>
To bring events I dreaded, yet desired.<br>
We were in constant intercourse: walks, rides,<br>
Picnics and sails, filled weeks of golden weather,<br>
And almost hourly we were thrown together.<br>
No words were spoken of rebuke or scorn:<br>
Good friends we seemed. But as a gulf divides<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 64]</span>This land and that, though lying side by side,<br>
So rolled a gulf between us&#8212;deep and wide&#8212;<br>
The gulf of doubt, which widened slowly morn<br>
And noon and night.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Free and informal were<br>
These picnics and excursions. Yet, although<br>
Helen and I would sometimes choose to go<br>
Without our escorts, leaving them quite free.<br>
It happened alway Roy would seek out me<br>
Ere passed the day, while Vivian walked with her.<br>
I had no thought of flirting. Roy was just<br>
Like some dear brother, and I quite forgot<br>
The kinship was so distant it was not<br>
Safe to rely upon in perfect trust,<br>
Without reserve or caution. Many a time<br>
When there was some steep mountain side to climb,<br>
And I grew weary, he would say, "Maurine,<br>
Come rest you here." And I would go and lean<br>
My head upon his shoulder, or would stand<br>
And let him hold in his my willing hand.<br>
The while he stroked it gently with his own.<br>
Or I would let him clasp me with his arm,<br>
Nor entertained a thought of any harm,<br>
Nor once supposed but Vivian was alone<br>
In his suspicions. But ere long the truth<br>
I learned in consternation! both Aunt Ruth<br>
And Helen, honestly, in faith believed<br>
That Roy and I were lovers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Undeceived,<br>
Some careless words might open Vivian's eyes<br>
And spoil my plans. So reasoning in this wise,<br>
To all their sallies I in jest replied,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 65]</span>To naught assented, and yet naught denied,<br>
With Roy unchanged remaining, confident<br>
Each understood just what the other meant.<br>

<br>

If I grew weary of this double part,<br>
And self&#8209;imposed deception caused my heart<br>
Sometimes to shrink, I needed but to gaze<br>
On Helen's face: that wore a look ethereal,<br>
As if she dwelt above the things material<br>
And held communion with the angels. So<br>
I fed my strength and courage through the days.<br>
What time the harvest moon rose full and clear<br>
And cast its ling'ring radiance on the earth,<br>
We made a feast; and called from far and near,<br>
Our friends, who came to share the scene of mirth.<br>
Fair forms and faces flitted to and fro;<br>
But none more sweet than Helen's. Robed in white,<br>
She floated like a vision through the dance.<br>
So frailly fragile and so phantom fair,<br>
She seemed like some stray spirit of the air,<br>
And was pursued by many an anxious glance<br>
That looked to see her fading from the sight<br>
Like figures that a dreamer sees at night.<br>

<br>

And noble men and gallants graced the scene:<br>
Yet none more noble or more grand of mien<br>
Than Vivian&#8212;broad of chest and shoulder, tall<br>
And finely formed, as any Grecian god<br>
Whose high&#8209;arched foot on Mount Olympus trod.<br>
His clear&#8209;cut face was beardless; and, like those<br>
Same Grecian statues, when in calm repose,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 66]</span>Was it in hue and feature. Framed in hair<br>
Dark and abundant; lighted by large eyes<br>
That could be cold as steel in winter air,<br>
Or warm and sunny as Italian skies.<br>

<br>

Weary of mirth and music, and the sound<br>
Of tripping feet, I sought a moment's rest<br>
Within the lib'ry, where a group I found<br>
Of guests, discussing with apparent zest<br>
Some theme of interest&#8212;Vivian, near the while,<br>
Leaning and listening with his slow odd smile.<br>
"Now Miss La Pelle, we will appeal to you,"<br>
Cried young Guy Semple, as I entered. "We<br>
Have been discussing right before his face,<br>
All unrebuked by him, as you may see,<br>
A poem lately published by our friend:<br>
And we are quite divided. I contend<br>
The poem is a libel and untrue<br>
I hold the fickle women are but few,<br>
Compared with those who are like yon fair moon<br>
That, ever faithful, rises in her place<br>
Whether she's greeted by the flowers of June,<br>
Or cold and dreary stretches of white space."<br>

<br>

"Oh!" cried another, "Mr. Dangerfield,<br>
Look to your laurels! or you needs must yield<br>
The crown to Semple, who, 'tis very plain,<br>
Has mounted Pegasus and grasped his mane."<br>

<br>

All laughed: and then, as Guy appealed to me<br>
I answered lightly, "My young friend, I fear<br>
You chose a most unlucky simile<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 67]</span>To prove the truth of woman. To her place<br>
The moon does rise&#8212;but with a different face<br>
Each time she comes. But now I needs must hear<br>
The poem read, before I can consent<br>
To pass my judgment on the sentiment."<br>

<br>

All clamored that the author was the man<br>
To read the poem: and, with tones that said<br>
More than the cutting, scornful words he read,<br>
Taking the book Guy gave him, he began:<br>

<br>

<blockquote>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;HER LOVE.<br>

<br>

The sands upon the ocean side<br>
That change about with every tide,<br>
And never true to one abide,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A woman's love I liken to.<br>

<br>

The summer zephyrs, light and vain,<br>
That sing the same alluring strain<br>
To every grass blade on the plain&#8212;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A woman's love is nothing more.<br>

<br>

The sunshine of an April day<br>
That comes to warm you with its ray,<br>
But while you smile has flown away&#8212;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A woman's love is like to this.<br>

<br>

God made poor woman with no heart,<br>
But gave her skill, and tact, and art,<br>
And so she lives, and plays her part.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We must not blame, but pity her.<br>

<br>

She leans to man&#8212;but just to hear<br>
The praise he whispers in her ear,<br>
Herself, not him, she holdeth dear&#8212;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;O fool! to be deceived by her.<br>

<br>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 68]</span>To sate her selfish thirst she quaffs<br>
The love of strong hearts in sweet draughts<br>
Then throws them lightly by and laughs,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Too weak to understand their pain.<br>

<br>

As changeful as the winds that blow<br>
From every region, to and fro,<br>
Devoid of heart, she cannot know<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The suffering of a human heart.<br>
</blockquote>

<br>

I knew the cold, fixed gaze of Vivian's eyes<br>
Saw the slow color to my forehead rise;<br>
But lightly answered, toying with my fan,<br>
"That sentiment is very like a man!<br>
Men call us fickle, but they do us wrong;<br>
We're only frail and helpless, men are strong;<br>
And when love dies, they take the poor dead thing<br>
And make a shroud out of their suffering,<br>
And drag the corpse about with them for years.<br>
But we?&#8212;we mourn it for a day with tears!<br>
And then we robe it for its last long rest,<br>
And being women, feeble things at best,<br>
We cannot dig the grave ourselves. And so<br>
We call strong&#8209;limbed New Love to lay it low:<br>
Immortal sexton he! whom Venus sends<br>
To do this service for her earthly friends,<br>
The trusty fellow digs the grave so deep<br>
Nothing disturbs the dead laid there to sleep."<br>

<br>

The laugh that followed had not died away<br>
Ere Roy Montaine came seeking me, to say<br>
The band was tuning for our waltz, and so<br>
Back to the ball&#8209;room bore me. In the glow<br>
And heat and whirl, my strength ere long was spent,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 69]</span>And I grew faint and dizzy, and we went<br>
Out on the cool moonlighted portico,<br>
And, sitting there, Roy drew my languid head<br>
Upon the shelter of his breast, and bent<br>
His smiling eyes upon me, as he said,<br>
"I'll try the mesmerism of my touch<br>
To work a cure: be very quiet now,<br>
And let me make some passes o'er your brow.<br>
Why, how it throbs! you've exercised too much!<br>
I shall not let you dance again to&#8209;night."<br>

<br>

Just then before us, in the broad moonlight,<br>
Two forms were mirrored: and I turned my face<br>
To catch the teasing and mischievous glance<br>
Of Helen's eyes, as, heated by the dance,<br>
Leaning on Vivian's arm, she sought this place.<br>
<br>
"I beg your pardon," came in that round tone<br>
Of his low voice. "I think we do intrude."<br>
Bowing, they turned, and left us quite alone<br>
Ere I could speak, or change my attitude.<br>

<blockquote><blockquote>
A visit to a cave some miles away<br>
Was next in order. So, one sunny day,<br>
Four prancing steeds conveyed a laughing load<br>
Of merry pleasure&#8209;seekers o'er the road.<br>
A basket picnic, music and croquet<br>
Were in the programme. Skies were blue and clear,<br>
And cool winds whispered of the Autumn near.<br>
The merry&#8209;makers filled the time with pleasure:<br>
Some floated to the music's rhythmic measure,<br>
Some played, some promenaded on the green.<br>

<br>

Ticked off by happy hearts, the moments passed.<br>
The afternoon, all glow and glimmer, came.<br>
Helen and Roy were leaders of some game,<br>
And Vivian was not visible.<br>

I challenge you to climb yon cliff with me!<br>
And who shall tire, or reach the summit last<br>
Must pay a forfeit," cried a romping maid.<br>
"Come! start at once, or own you are afraid."<br>
So challenged I made ready for the race,<br>
Deciding first the forfeit was to be<br>
A handsome pair of bootees to replace<br>
The victor's loss who made the rough ascent.<br>
The cliff was steep and stony. On we went<br>
As eagerly as if the path was Fame,<br>
And what we climbed for, glory and a name.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 71]</span>My hands were bruised; my garments sadly rent,<br>
But on I clambered. Soon I heard a cry,<br>
"Maurine! Maurine! my strength is wholly spent!<br>
You've won the boots! I'm going back&#8212;good bye!"<br>
And back she turned, in spite of laugh and jeer.<br>

<br>

I reached the summit: and its solitude,<br>
Wherein no living creature did intrude,<br>
Save some sad birds that wheeled and circled near,<br>
I found far sweeter than the scene below.<br>
Alone with One who knew my hidden woe,<br>
I did not feel so much alone as when<br>
I mixed with th' unthinking throngs of men.<br>

<br>

Some flowers that decked the barren, sterile place<br>
I plucked, and read the lesson they conveyed,<br>
That in our lives, albeit dark with shade<br>
And rough and hard with labor, yet may grow<br>
The flowers of Patience, Sympathy, and Grace.<br>

<br>

As I walked on in meditative thought,<br>
A serpent writhed across my pathway; not<br>
A large or deadly serpent; yet the sight<br>
Filled me with ghastly terror and affright.<br>
I shrieked aloud: a darkness veiled my eyes&#8212;<br>
And I fell fainting 'neath the watchful skies.<br>

<br>

I was no coward. Country&#8209;bred and born,<br>
I had no feeling but the keenest scorn<br>
For those fine lady "ah's" and "oh's" of fear<br>
So much assumed (when any man is near).<br>
But God implanted in each human heart<br>
A natural horror, and a sickly dread<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 72]</span>Of that accurs&#232;d, slimy, creeping thing<br>
That squirms a limbless carcass o'er the ground.<br>
And where that inborn loathing is not found<br>
You'll find the serpent qualities instead.<br>
Who fears it not, himself is next of kin,<br>
And in his bosom holds some treacherous art<br>
Whereby to counteract its venomed sting.<br>
And all are sired by Satan&#8212;Chief of Sin.<br>

<br>

Who loathes not that foul creature of the dust,<br>
However fair in seeming, I distrust.<br>

<br>

I woke from my unconsciousness, to know<br>
I leaned upon a broad and manly breast,<br>
And Vivian's voice was speaking, soft and low,<br>
Sweet whispered words of passion, o'er and o'er.<br>
I dared not breathe. Had I found Eden's shore?<br>
Was this a foretaste of eternal bliss?<br>
"My love," he sighed, his voice like winds that moan<br>
Before a rain in Summer time, "My own,<br>
For one sweet stolen moment, lie and rest<br>
Upon this heart that loves and hates you both!<br>
O fair false face! Why were you made so fair!<br>
O mouth of Southern sweetness! that ripe kiss<br>
That hangs upon you, I do take an oath<br>
<i>His</i> lips shall never gather. There!&#8212;and there!<br>
I steal it from him. Are you his&#8212;all his?<br>
Nay you are mine, this moment, as I dreamed&#8212;<br>
Blind fool&#8212;believing you were what you seemed&#8212;<br>
You would be mine in all the years to come.<br>
Fair fiend! I love and hate you in a breath.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 73]</span>O God! if this white pallor were but <i>death</i>,<br>
And I were stretched beside you, cold and dumb,<br>
My arms about you, so&#8212;in fond embrace!<br>
My lips pressed, so&#8212;upon your dying face!"<br>

<br>

"Woman, how dare you bring me to such shame!<br>
How dare you drive me to an act like this,<br>
To steal from your unconscious lips the kiss<br>
You lured me on to think my rightful claim!<br>
O frail and puny woman! could you know<br>
The devil that you waken in the hearts<br>
You snare and bind in your enticing arts,<br>
The thin, pale stuff that in your veins doth flow<br>
Would freeze in terror.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Strange you have such power<br>
To please, or pain us, poor, weak, soulless things&#8212;<br>
Devoid of passion as a senseless flower!<br>
Like butterflies, your only boast, your wings.<br>
There, now, I scorn you&#8212;scorn you from this hour,<br>
And hate myself for having talked of love!"<br>

<br>

He pushed me from him. And I felt as those<br>
Doomed angels must, when pearly gates above<br>
Are closed against them.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With a feigned surprise<br>
I started up and opened wide my eyes,<br>
And looked about. Then in confusion rose<br>
And stood before him.<br>

<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Pardon me, I pray!"<br>
He said quite coldly. "Half an hour ago<br>
I left you with the company below,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 74]</span>And sought this cliff. A moment since you cried,<br>
It seemed, in sudden terror and alarm.<br>
I came in time to see you swoon away.<br>
You'll need assistance down the rugged side<br>
Of this steep cliff. I pray you take my arm."<br>

<br>

So, formal and constrained, we passed along,<br>
Rejoined our friends, and mingled with the throng<br>
To have no further speech again that day.<br>

<br>

Next morn there came a bulky document,<br>
The legal firm of Blank &amp; Blank had sent,<br>
Containing news unlooked for. An estate<br>
Which proved a cosy fortune&#8212;no&#8209;wise great<br>
Or princely&#8212;had in France been left to me,<br>
My grandsire's last descendant. And it brought<br>
A sense of joy and freedom in the thought<br>
Of foreign travel, which I hoped would be<br>
A panacea for my troubled mind,<br>
That longed to leave the olden scenes behind<br>
With all their recollections, and to flee<br>
To some strange country.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I was in such haste<br>
To put between me and my native land<br>
The briny ocean's desolating waste,<br>
I gave Aunt Ruth no peace, until she planned<br>
To sail that week, two months: though she was fain<br>
To wait until the Springtime. Roy Montaine<br>
Would be our guide and escort.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No one dreamed<br>
The cause of my strange hurry, but all seemed<br>
To think good fortune had quite turned my brain.<br>
One bright October morning, when the woods<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 75]</span>Had donned their purple mantles and red hoods<br>
In honor of the Frost King, Vivian came,<br>
Bringing some green leaves, tipped with crimson flame,&#8212;<br>
First trophies of the Autumn time.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And Roy<br>
Made a proposal that we all should go<br>
And ramble in the forest for a while.<br>
But Helen said she was not well&#8212;and so<br>
Must stay at home. Then Vivian, with a smile,<br>
Responded, "I will stay and talk to you,<br>
And they may go;" at which her two cheeks grew<br>
Like twin blush roses;&#8212;dyed with love's red wave,<br>
Her fair face shone transfigured with great joy.<br>

<br>

And Vivian saw&#8212;and suddenly was grave.<br>

<br>

Roy took my arm in that protecting way<br>
Peculiar to some men, which seems to say,<br>
"I shield my own," a manner pleasing, e'en<br>
When we are conscious that it does not mean<br>
More than a simple courtesy. A woman<br>
Whose heart is wholly feminine and human,<br>
And not unsexed by hobbies, likes to be<br>
The object of that tender chivalry,<br>
That guardianship which man bestows on her,<br>
Yet mixed with deference; as if she were<br>
Half child, half angel.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though she may be strong,<br>
Noble and self&#8209;reliant, not afraid<br>
To raise her hand and voice against all wrong<br>
And all oppression, yet if she be made,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 76]</span>With all the independence of her thought,<br>
A woman womanly, as God designed,<br>
Albeit she may have as great a mind<br>
As man, her brother, yet his strength of arm<br>
His muscle and his boldness she has not,<br>
And cannot have without she loses what<br>
Is far more precious, modesty and grace.<br>
So, walking on in her appointed place,<br>
She does not strive to ape him, nor pretend<br>
But that she needs him for a guide and friend,<br>
To shield her with his greater strength from harm.<br>

<br>

We reached the forest; wandered to and fro<br>
Through many a winding path and dim retreat.<br>
Till I grew weary: when I chose a seat<br>
Upon an oak tree, which had been laid low<br>
By some wind storm, or by some lightning stroke.<br>
And Roy stood just below me, where the ledge<br>
On which I sat sloped steeply to the edge<br>
Of sunny meadows lying at my feet.<br>
One hand held mine; the other grasped a limb<br>
That cast its checkered shadows over him;<br>
And, with his head thrown back, his dark eyes raised<br>
And fixed upon me, silently he gazed<br>
Until I, smiling, turned to him and spoke:<br>
"Give words, my cousin, to those thoughts that rise,<br>
And, like dumb spirits, look forth from your eyes."<br>

<br>

The smooth and even darkness of his cheek<br>
Was stained one moment by a flush of red.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 77]</span>He swayed his lithe form nearer as he stood<br>
Still clinging to the branch above his head.<br>
His brilliant eyes grew darker; and he said,<br>
With sudden passion, "Do you bid me speak?<br>
I can not, then, keep silence if I would.<br>
That hateful fortune, coming as it did,<br>
Forbade my speaking sooner; for I knew<br>
A harsh tongued world would quickly misconstrue<br>
My motive for a meaner one. But, sweet,<br>
So big my heart has grown with love for you<br>
I can not shelter it, or keep it hid.<br>
And so I cast it throbbing at your feet,<br>
For you to guard and cherish, or to break.<br>
Maurine, I love you better than my life.<br>
My friend&#8212;my cousin&#8212;be still more, my wife!<br>
Maurine, Maurine, what answer do you make?"<br>

<br>

I scarce could breathe for wonderment; and numb<br>
With truth that fell too suddenly, sat dumb<br>
With sheer amaze, and stared at Roy with eyes<br>
That looked no feeling but complete surprise.<br>
He swayed so near his breath was on my cheek.<br>
"Maurine, Maurine," he whispered, "will you speak?"<br>

<br>

Then suddenly, as o'er some magic glass<br>
One picture in a score of shapes will pass,<br>
I seemed to see Roy glide before my gaze.<br>
First, as the playmate of my earlier days&#8212;<br>
Next, as my kin&#8212;and then my valued friend,<br>
And last, my lover. As when colors blend<br>
In some unlooked&#8209;for group before our eyes,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 78]</span>We hold the glass, and look them o'er and o'er<br>
So now I gazed on Roy in his new guise,<br>
In which he ne'er appeared to me before.<br>

<br>

His form was like a panther's in its grace,<br>
So lithe and supple, and of medium height,<br>
And garbed in all the elegance of fashion.<br>
His large black eyes were full of fire and passion,<br>
And in expression fearless, firm, and bright.<br>
His hair was like the very deeps of night,<br>
And hung in raven clusters 'round a face<br>
Of dark and flashing beauty.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He was more<br>
Like some romantic maiden's grand ideal<br>
Than like a common being. As I gazed<br>
Upon the handsome face to mine upraised,<br>
I saw before me, living, breathing, real,<br>
The hero of my early day&#8209;dreams: though<br>
So full my heart was with that clear&#8209;cut face,<br>
Which, all unlike, yet claimed the hero's place,<br>
I had not recognized him so before,<br>
Or thought of him, save as a valued friend.<br>
So now I called him, adding,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Foolish boy!<br>
Each word of love you utter aims a blow<br>
At that sweet trust I had reposed in you.<br>
I was so certain I had found a true,<br>
Steadfast man friend, on whom I could depend,<br>
And go on wholly trusting, to the end.<br>
Why did you shatter my delusion, Roy,<br>
By turning to a lover?"<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 79]</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why, indeed!<br>
Because I loved you more than any brother,<br>
Or any friend could love." Then he began<br>
To argue like a lawyer, and to plead<br>
With all his eloquence. And, listening,<br>
I strove to think it was a goodly thing<br>
To be so fondly loved by such a man,<br>
And it were best to give his wooing heed,<br>
And not deny him. Then before my eyes<br>
In all its clear&#8209;cut majesty, that other<br>
Haughty and poet&#8209;handsome face would rise<br>
And rob my purpose of all life and strength.<br>

<br>

Roy urged and argued, as Roy only could,<br>
With that impetuous, boyish eloquence.<br>
He held my hands, and vowed I must, and should<br>
Give some least hope; till, in my own defense,<br>
I turned upon him, and replied at length:<br>
"I thank you for the noble heart you offer:<br>
But it deserves a true one in exchange.<br>
I could love you if I loved not another<br>
Who keeps my heart; so I have none to proffer."<br>

<br>

Then, seeing how his dark eyes flashed, I said,<br>
"Dear Roy! I know my words seem very strange;<br>
But I love one I cannot hope to wed.<br>
A river rolls between us, dark and deep.<br>
To cross it&#8212;were to stain with blood my hand.<br>
You force my speech on what I fain would keep<br>
In my own bosom, but you understand?<br>
My heart is given to love that's sanctified,<br>
And now can feel no other.<br>

<br>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 80]</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Be you kind<br>
Dear Roy, my brother! speak of this no more,<br>
Lest pleading and denying should divide<br>
The hearts so long united. Let me find<br>
In you my cousin and my friend of yore<br>
And now come home. The morning, all too soon<br>
And unperceived, has melted into noon.<br>
Helen will miss us, and we must return."<br>

<br>

He took my hand, and helped me to arise,<br>
Smiling upon me with his sad dark eyes.<br>
Where passion's fires had, sudden, ceased to burn.<br>

<br>

"And so," he said, "too soon and unforeseen<br>
My friendship melted into love, Maurine.<br>
But, sweet! I am not wholly in the blame,<br>
For what you term my folly. You forgot,<br>
So long we'd known each other, I had not<br>
In truth a brother's or a cousin's claim.<br>
But I remembered, when through every nerve<br>
Your lightest touch went thrilling; and began<br>
To love you with that human love of man<br>
For comely woman. By your coaxing arts,<br>
You won your way into my heart of hearts,<br>
And all Platonic feelings put to rout.<br>
A maid should never lay aside reserve<br>
With one who's not her kinsman, out and out.<br>
But as we now, with measured steps, retrace<br>
The path we came, e'en so my heart I'll send,<br>
At your command, back to the olden place,<br>
And strive to love you only as a friend."<br>
I felt the justice of his mild reproof,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 81]</span>But answered laughing, "'Tis the same old cry:<br>
'The woman tempted me, and I did eat.'<br>
Since Adam's time we've heard it. But I'll try<br>
And be more prudent, sir, and hold aloof<br>
The fruit I never once had thought so sweet<br>
'Twould tempt you any. Now go dress for dinner,<br>
Thou sinned against! as also will the sinner.<br>
And guard each act, that no least look betray<br>
What's passed between us."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then I turned away<br>
And sought my room, low humming some old air<br>
That ceased upon the threshold; for mine eyes<br>
Fell on a face so glorified and fair<br>
All other senses, merged in that of sight,<br>
Were lost in contemplation of the bright<br>
And wond'rous picture, which had otherwise<br>
Made dim my vision.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Waiting in my room,<br>
Her whole face lit as by an inward flame<br>
That shed its halo 'round her, Helen stood;<br>
Her fair hands folded like a lily's leaves<br>
Weighed down by happy dews of summer eves.<br>
Upon her cheek the color went and came<br>
As sunlight flickers o'er a bed of bloom;<br>
And, like some slim young sapling of the wood,<br>
Her slender form leaned slightly; and her hair<br>
Fell 'round her loosely, in long curling strands<br>
All unconfined, and as by loving hands<br>
Tossed into bright confusion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Standing there,<br>
Her starry eyes uplifted, she did seem<br>
Like some unearthly creature of a dream;<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 82]</span>Until she started forward, gliding slowly,<br>
And broke the breathless silence, speaking lowly,<br>
As one grown meek, and humble in an hour,<br>
Bowing before some new and mighty power.<br>
<br>
"Maurine, Maurine!" she murmured, and again,<br>
"Maurine, my own sweet friend, Maurine!"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And then,<br>
Laying her love light hands upon my head,<br>
She leaned, and looked into my eyes, and said<br>
With voice that bore her joy in ev'ry tone,<br>
As winds that blow across a garden bed<br>
Are weighed with fragrance, "He is mine alone,<br>
And I am his&#8212;all his&#8212;his very own.<br>
So pledged this hour, by that most sacred tie<br>
Save one beneath God's over&#8209;arching sky.<br>
I could not wait to tell you of my bliss:<br>
I want your blessing, sweetheart! and your kiss."<br>
So hiding my heart's trouble with a smile,<br>
I leaned and kissed her dainty mouth; the while<br>
I felt a guilt&#8209;joy, as of some sweet sin,<br>
When my lips fell where his so late had been.<br>
And all day long I bore about with me<br>
A sense of shame&#8212;yet mixed with satisfaction,<br>
As some starved child might steal a loaf, and be<br>
Sad with the guilt resulting from her action,<br>
While yet the morsel in her mouth was sweet.<br>
That ev'ning when the house had settled down<br>
To sleep and quiet, to my room there crept<br>
A lithe young form, robed in a long white gown:<br>
With steps like fall of thistle&#8209;down she came,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 83]</span>Her mouth smile&#8209;wreathed; and, breathing low my name,<br>
Nestled in graceful beauty at my feet.<br>

<br>

"Sweetheart," she murmured softly, "ere I sleep,<br>
I needs must tell you all my tale of joy.<br>
Beginning where you left us&#8212;you and Roy.<br>
You saw the color flame upon my cheek<br>
When Vivian spoke of staying. So did he;&#8212;<br>
And, when we were alone, he gazed at me<br>
With such a strange look in his wond'rous eyes.<br>
The silence deepened; and I tried to speak<br>
Upon some common topic, but could not,<br>
My heart was in such tumult.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In this wise<br>
Five happy moments glided by us, fraught<br>
With hours of feeling. Vivian rose up then,<br>
And came and stood by me, and stroked my hair.<br>
And, in his low voice, o'er and o'er again,<br>
Said, 'Helen, little Helen, frail and fair.'<br>
Then took my face, and turned it to the light,<br>
And looking in my eyes, and seeing what<br>
Was shining from them, murmured, sweet and low,<br>
'Dear eyes, you cannot veil the truth from sight.<br>
You love me, Helen! answer, is it so?'<br>
And I made answer straightway, 'With my life<br>
And soul and strength I love you, O my love!'<br>
He leaned and took me gently to his breast,<br>
And said, 'Here then this dainty head shall rest<br>
Henceforth forever: O my little dove!<br>
My lily&#8209;bud&#8212;my fragile blossom&#8209;wife!'<br>

<br>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 84]</span>"And then I told him all my thoughts; and he<br>
Listened, with kisses for his comments, till<br>
My tale was finished. Then he said, 'I will<br>
Be frank with you, my darling, from the start,<br>
And hide no secret from you in my heart.<br>
I love you, Helen, but you are not first<br>
To rouse that love to being. Ere we met<br>
I loved a woman madly&#8212;never dreaming<br>
She was not all in truth she was in seeming.<br>
Enough! she proved to be that thing accursed<br>
Of God and man&#8212;a wily vain coquette.<br>
I hate myself for having loved her. Yet<br>
So much my heart spent on her, it must give<br>
A love less ardent, and less prodigal,<br>
Albeit just as tender and as true&#8212;<br>
A milder, yet a faithful love to you.<br>
Just as some evil fortune might befall<br>
A man's great riches, causing him to live<br>
In some low cot, all unpretending, still<br>
As much his home&#8212;as much his loved retreat,<br>
As was the princely palace on the hill,<br>
E'en so I give you all that's left, my sweet!<br>
Of my heart&#8209;fortune.'<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;'That were more to me,'<br>
I made swift smiling answer, 'than to be<br>
The worshiped consort of a king.' And so<br>
Our faith was pledged. But Vivian would not go<br>
Until I vowed to wed him New Year day.<br>
And I am sad because you go away<br>
Before that time. I shall not feel half wed<br>
Without you here. Postpone your trip and stay,<br>
And be my bridesmaid."<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 85]</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Nay, I cannot, dear!<br>
'Twould disarrange our plans for half a year.<br>
I'll be in Europe New Year day," I said,<br>
"And send congratulations by the cable."<br>
And from my soul thanked Providence for sparing<br>
The pain, to me, of sharing in, and wearing<br>
The festal garments of a wedding scene,<br>
While all my heart was hung with sorrow's sable.<br>
Forgetting for a season, that between<br>
The cup and lip lies many a chance of loss,<br>
I lived in my near future, confident<br>
All would be as I planned it; and, across<br>
The briny waste of waters, I should find<br>
Some balm and comfort for my troubled mind.<br>
The sad Fall days, like maidens auburn&#8209;tressed<br>
And amber&#8209;eyed, in purple garments dressed,<br>
Passed by, and dropped their tears upon the tomb<br>
Of fair Queen Summer, buried in her bloom.<br>

<br>

Roy left us for a time, and Helen went<br>
To make the nuptial preparations. Then,<br>
Aunt Ruth complained one day of feeling ill:<br>
Her veins ran red with fever; and the skill<br>
Of two physicians could not stem the tide.<br>
The house, that rang so late with laugh and jest,<br>
Grew ghostly with low whispered sounds; and when<br>
The Autumn day, that I had thought to be<br>
Bounding upon the billows of the sea,<br>
Came sobbing in, it found me pale and worn,<br>
Striving to keep away that unloved guest<br>
Who comes unbidden, making hearts to mourn.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 86]</span>Through all the anxious weeks I watched beside<br>
The suff'rer's couch, Roy was my help and stay;<br>
Others were kind, but he alone each day<br>
Brought strength and comfort, by his cheerful face,<br>
And hopeful words, that fell in that sad place<br>
Like rays of light upon a darkened way.<br>
November passed; and Winter, crisp and chill,<br>
In robes of ermine walked on plain and hill.<br>
Returning light and life dispelled the gloom<br>
That cheated Death had brought us from the tomb.<br>
Aunt Ruth was saved, and slowly getting better&#8212;<br>
Was dressed each day, and walked about the room.<br>
Then came one morning in the Eastern mail,<br>
A little white&#8209;winged birdling of a letter.<br>
I broke the seal and read,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Maurine, my own!<br>
I hear Aunt Ruth is better, and am glad.<br>
I felt so sorry for you; and so sad<br>
To think I left you when I did&#8212;alone<br>
To bear your pain and worry, and those nights<br>
Of weary, anxious watching.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Vivian writes<br>
Your plans are changed now, and you will not sail<br>
Before the Springtime. So you'll come and be<br>
My bridesmaid, darling! Do not say me nay.<br>
But three weeks more of girlhood left to me.<br>
Come, if you can, just two weeks from to&#8209;day,<br>
And make your preparations here. My sweet!<br>
Indeed I am not glad Aunt Ruth was ill&#8212;<br>
I'm sorry she has suffered so; and still<br>
I'm thankful something happened, so you stayed.<br>
I'm sure my wedding would be incomplete<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 87]</span>Without your presence. Selfish, I'm afraid<br>
You'll think your Helen. But I love you so,<br>
How can I be quite willing you should go?<br>
Come Christmas Eve, or earlier. Let me know<br>
And I will meet you, dearie! at the train.<br>
Your happy, loving Helen."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then the pain<br>
That, hidden under later pain and care,<br>
Had made no moan, but silent, seemed to sleep,<br>
Woke from its trance&#8209;like lethargy, to steep<br>
My tortured heart in anguish and despair.<br>

<br>

I had relied too fully on my skill<br>
In bending circumstances to my will:<br>
And now I was rebuked and made to see<br>
That God alone knoweth what is to be.<br>
Then came a messenger from Vivian, who<br>
Came not himself, as he was wont to do,<br>
But sent his servant each new day to bring<br>
A kindly message, or an offering<br>
Of juicy fruits to cool the lips of fever,<br>
Or dainty hot&#8209;house blossoms, with their bloom<br>
To brighten up the convalescent's room.<br>
But now the servant only brought a line<br>
From Vivian Dangerfield to Roy Montaine,<br>
"Dear Sir, and Friend"&#8212;in letters bold and plain,<br>
Written on cream&#8209;white paper, so it ran:<br>
"It is the will and pleasure of Miss Trevor,<br>
And therefore doubly so a wish of mine,<br>
That you shall honor me next New Year Eve,<br>
My wedding hour, by standing as best man.<br>
Miss Trevor has six bridesmaids I believe.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 88]</span>Being myself a novice in the art&#8212;<br>
If I should fail in acting well my part,<br>
I'll need protection 'gainst the regiment<br>
Of outraged ladies. So, I pray, consent<br>
To stand by me in time of need, and shield<br>
Your friend sincerely, Vivian Dangerfield."<br>

<br>

The last least hope had vanished; I must drain,<br>
E'en to the dregs, this bitter cup of pain.<br>

<blockquote><blockquote>
There was a week of bustle and of hurry;<br>
A stately home echoed to voices sweet,<br>
Calling, replying; and to tripping feet<br>
Of busy bridesmaids, running to and fro,<br>
With all that girlish fluttering and flurry<br>
Preceding such occasions.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helen's room<br>
Was like a lily&#8209;garden, all in bloom,<br>
Decked with the dainty robes of her trousseau.<br>
My robe was fashioned by swift, skillful hands&#8212;<br>
A thing of beauty, elegant and rich,<br>
A mystery of loopings, puffs and bands;<br>
And as I watched it growing, stitch by stitch,<br>
I felt as one might feel who should behold<br>
With vision trance&#8209;like, where his body lay<br>
In deathly slumber, simulating clay,<br>
His grave&#8209;cloth sewed together, fold on fold.<br>

<br>

I lived with ev'ry nerve upon the strain,<br>
As men go into battle; and the pain,<br>
That, more and more, to my sad heart revealed,<br>
Grew ghastly with its horrors, was concealed<br>
From mortal eyes by superhuman power,<br>
That God bestowed upon me, hour by hour.<br>

<br>

What night the Old Year gave unto the New<br>
The key of human happiness and woe,<br>
The pointed stars, upon their field of blue,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 90]</span>Shone, white and perfect, o'er a world below,<br>
Of snow&#8209;clad beauty; all the trees were dressed<br>
In gleaming garments, decked with diadems,<br>
Each seeming like a bridal&#8209;bidden guest,<br>
Coming o'er&#8209;laden with a gift of gems.<br>

<br>

The bustle of the dressing room; the sound<br>
Of eager voices in discourse; the clang<br>
Of "sweet bells jangled"; thud of steel&#8209;clad feet<br>
That beat swift music on the frozen ground&#8212;<br>
All blent together in my brain, and rang<br>
A medley of strange noises, incomplete,<br>
And full of discords.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then out on the night<br>
Streamed from this open vestibule, a light<br>
That lit the velvet blossoms which we trod,<br>
With all the hues of those that deck the sod.<br>
The grand cathedral windows were ablaze<br>
With gorgeous colors; through a sea of bloom,<br>
Up the long aisle, to join the waiting groom,<br>
The bridal cortege passed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As some lost soul<br>
Might surge on with the curious crowd, to gaze<br>
Upon its coffined body, so I went<br>
With that glad festal throng. The organ sent<br>
Great waves of melody along the air,<br>
That broke and fell, in liquid drops, like spray,<br>
On happy hearts that listened. But to me<br>
It sounded faintly, as if miles away,<br>
A troubled spirit, sitting in despair<br>
Beside the sad and ever&#8209;moaning sea,<br>
Gave utterance to sighing sounds of dole.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 91]</span>We paused before the altar. Framed in flowers,<br>
The white&#8209;robed man of God stood forth.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I heard<br>
The solemn service open; through long hours<br>
I seemed to stand and listen, while each word<br>
Fell on my ear as falls the sound of clay<br>
Upon the coffin of the worshiped dead.<br>
The stately father gave the bride away:<br>
The bridegroom circled with a golden band<br>
The taper finger of her dainty hand.<br>
The last imposing, binding words were said&#8212;<br>
"What God has joined let no man put asunder"&#8212;<br>
And all my strife with self was at an end;<br>
My lover was the husband of my friend.<br>

<br>

How strangely, in some awful hour of pain,<br>
External trifles with our sorrows blend!<br>
I never hear the mighty organ's thunder,<br>
I never catch the scent of heliotrope,<br>
Nor see stained windows all ablaze with light,<br>
Without that dizzy whirling of the brain,<br>
And all the ghastly feeling of that night,<br>
When my sick heart relinquished love and hope.<br>

<br>

The pain we feel so keenly may depart,<br>
And e'en its memory cease to haunt the heart;<br>
But some slight thing, a perfume, or a sound<br>
Will probe the closed recesses of the wound,<br>
And for a moment bring the old&#8209;time smart.<br>

<br>

Congratulations, kisses, tears and smiles,<br>
Good&#8209;byes and farewells given; then across<br>
The snowy waste of weary wintry miles,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 92]</span>Back to my girlhood's home, where, through each room,<br>
For evermore pale phantoms of delight<br>
Should aimless wander, always in my sight,<br>
Pointing, with ghostly fingers, to the tomb<br>
Wet with the tears of living pain and loss.<br>

<br>

The sleepless nights of watching and of care,<br>
Followed by that one week of keenest pain,<br>
Taxing my weakened system, and my brain,<br>
Brought on a ling'ring illness.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Day by day,<br>
In that strange, apathetic state I lay,<br>
Of mental and of physical despair.<br>
I had no pain, no fever, and no chill,<br>
But lay without ambition, strength, or will,<br>
Knowing no wish for anything but rest,<br>
Which seemed, of all God's store of gifts, the best.<br>
<br>
Physicians came and shook their heads and sighed;<br>
And to their score of questions I replied,<br>
With but one languid answer, o'er and o'er.<br>
"I am so weary&#8212;weary&#8212;nothing more."<br>

<br>

I slept, and dreamed I was some feathered thing,<br>
Flying through space with ever&#8209;aching wing,<br>
Seeking a ship called Rest all snowy white,<br>
That sailed and sailed before me, just in sight,<br>
But always one unchanging distance kept,<br>
And woke more weary than before I slept.<br>
<br>

I slept, and dreamed I ran to win a prize.<br>
A hand from heaven held down before my eyes.<br>
All eagerness I sought it&#8212;it was gone,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 93]</span>But shone in all its beauty farther on.<br>
I ran, and ran, and ran, in eager quest<br>
Of that great prize, whereon was written "rest,"<br>
Which ever just beyond my reach did gleam,<br>
And wakened doubly weary with my dream.<br>

<br>

I dreamed I was a crystal drop of rain,<br>
That saw a snow&#8209;white lily on the plain,<br>
And left the cloud to nestle in her breast.<br>
I fell and fell, but nevermore found rest&#8212;<br>
I fell and fell, but found no stopping place,<br>
Through leagues and leagues of never&#8209;ending space,<br>
While space illimitable stretched before.<br>

<br>

And all these dreams but wearied me the more.<br>

<br>

Familiar voices sounded in my room&#8212;<br>
Aunt Ruth's and Roy's, and Helen's: but they seemed<br>
A part of some strange fancy I had dreamed,<br>
And now remembered dimly.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Wrapped in gloom,<br>
My mind, o'er taxed, lost hold of time at last,<br>
Ignored its future, and forgot its past,<br>
And groped along the present, as a light,<br>
Carried, uncovered, through the fogs of night,<br>
Will flicker faintly.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But I felt, at length,<br>
When March winds brought vague rumors of the spring,<br>
A certain sense of "restlessness with rest."<br>
My aching frame was weary of repose,<br>
And wanted action.<br>

<br>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 94]</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then slow&#8209;creeping strength<br>
Came back with Mem'ry, hand in hand, to bring<br>
And lay upon my sore and bleeding breast,<br>
Grim&#8209;visaged Recollection's thorny rose.<br>
I gained, and failed. One day could ride and walk,<br>
The next would find me prostrate: while a flock<br>
Of ghostly thoughts, like phantom birds, would flit<br>
About the chambers of my heart, or sit,<br>
Pale spectres of the past, with folded wings,<br>
Perched, silently, upon the voiceless strings,<br>
That once resounded to Hope's happy lays.<br>

<br>

So passed the ever&#8209;changing April days.<br>
When May came, lightsome footed, o'er the lea,<br>
Accompanied by kind Aunt Ruth and Roy,<br>
I bade farewell to home with secret joy,<br>
And turned my wan face eastward to the sea.<br>
Roy planned our route of travel: for all lands<br>
Were one to him. Or Egypt's burning sands,<br>
Or Alps of Switzerland, or stately Rome,<br>
All were familiar as the fields of home.<br>

<br>

There was a year of wand'ring to and fro,<br>
Like restless spirits; scaling mountain heights;<br>
Dwelling among the countless, rare delights<br>
Of lands historic; turning dusty pages,<br>
Stamped with the tragedies of mighty ages;<br>
Gazing upon the scenes of bloody acts,<br>
Of kings long buried&#8212;bare, unvarnished facts,<br>
Surpassing wildest fictions of the brain;<br>
Rubbing against all people, high and low,<br>
And by this contact feeling Self to grow<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 95]</span>Smaller and less important, and the vein<br>
Of human kindness deeper, seeing God,<br>
Unto the humble delver of the sod,<br>
And to the ruling monarch on the throne,<br>
Has given hope, ambition, joy, and pain,<br>
And that all hearts have feelings like our own.<br>

<br>

There is no school that disciplines the mind,<br>
And broadens thought, like contact with mankind.<br>
The college&#8209;prisoned greybeard, who has burned<br>
The midnight lamp, and book&#8209;bound knowledge learned,<br>
Till sciences or classics hold no lore<br>
He has not conned and studied, o'er and o'er,<br>
Is but a babe in wisdom, when compared<br>
With some unlettered wand'rer, who has shared<br>
The hospitalities of every land;<br>
Felt touch of brother in each proffered hand;<br>
Made man his study, and the world his college,<br>
And gained this grand epitome of knowledge:<br>
Each human being has a heart and soul,<br>
And self is but an atom of the whole.<br>
I hold he is best learn&#232;d and most wise,<br>
Who best and most can love and sympathize.<br>
Book&#8209;wisdom makes us vain and self&#8209;contained;<br>
Our banded minds go round in little grooves;<br>
But constant friction with the world removes<br>
These iron foes to freedom, and we rise<br>
To grander heights, and, all untrammeled, find<br>
A better atmosphere and clearer skies;<br>
And through its broadened realm, no longer chained,<br>
Thought travels freely, leaving Self behind.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 96]</span>Where'er we chanced to wander or to roam,<br>
Glad letters came from Helen; happy things,<br>
Like little birds that followed on swift wings,<br>
Bringing their tender messages from home.<br>
Her days were poems, beautiful, complete.<br>
The rhythm perfect, and the burden sweet.<br>
She was so happy&#8212;happy, and so blest.<br>

<br>

My heart had found contentment in that year.<br>
With health restored, my life seemed full of cheer<br>
The heart of youth turns ever to the light;<br>
Sorrow and gloom may curtain it like night,<br>
But, in its very anguish and unrest,<br>
It beats and tears the pall&#8209;like folds away,<br>
And finds again the sunlight of the day.<br>

<br>

And yet, despite the changes without measure,<br>
Despite sight&#8209;seeing, round on round of pleasure;<br>
Despite new friends, new suitors, still my heart<br>
Was conscious of a something lacking, where<br>
Love once had dwelt, and afterward despair.<br>
Now love was buried; and despair had flown<br>
Before the healthful zephyrs that had blown<br>
From heights serene and lofty; and the place<br>
Where both had dwelt, was empty, voiceless space<br>
And so I took my long&#8209;loved study, art,<br>
The dreary vacuum in my life to fill,<br>
And worked, and labored, with a right good will.<br>
Aunt Ruth and I took rooms in Rome; while Roy<br>
Lingered in Scotland, with his new&#8209;found joy.<br>
A dainty little lassie, Grace Kildare,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 97]</span>Had snared him in her flossy, flaxen hair,<br>
And made him captive.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We were thrown, by chance,<br>
In contact with her people while in France<br>
The previous season: she was wholly sweet<br>
And fair and gentle; so n&#228;ive, and yet<br>
So womanly, she was at once the pet<br>
Of all our party; and, ere many days,<br>
Won by her fresh face, and her artless ways,<br>
Roy fell a helpless captive at her feet.<br>
Her home was in the Highlands; and she came<br>
Of good old stock, of fair untarnished fame.<br>

<br>

Through all these months Roy had been true as steel;<br>
And by his every action made me feel<br>
He was my friend and brother, and no more.<br>
The same big&#8209;souled and trusty friend of yore.<br>
Yet, in my secret heart, I wished I knew<br>
Whether the love he felt one time was dead,<br>
Or only hidden, for my sake, from view.<br>
So when he came to me one day, and said,<br>
The velvet blackness of his eyes ashine<br>
With light of love and triumph: "Cousin, mine,<br>
Congratulate me! She whom I adore<br>
Has pledged to me the promise of her hand;<br>
Her heart I have already," I was glad<br>
With double gladness, for it freed my mind<br>
Of fear that he, in secret, might be sad.<br>

<br>

From March till June had left her moons behind,<br>
And merged her rose&#8209;red beauty in July,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 98]</span>There was no message from my native land.<br>
Then came a few brief lines, by Vivian penned:<br>
Death had been near to Helen, but passed by;<br>
The danger was now over. God was kind;<br>
The mother and the child were both alive;<br>
No other child was ever known to thrive<br>
As throve this one, nurse had been heard to say.<br>
The infant was a wonder, every way.<br>
And, at command of Helen he would send<br>
A lock of baby's golden hair to me.<br>
And did I, on my honor, ever see<br>
Such hair before? Helen would write, ere long:<br>
She gained quite slowly, but would soon be strong&#8212;<br>
Stronger than ever, so the doctors said.<br>
I took the tiny ringlet, golden&#8212;fair,<br>
Mayhap his hand had severed from the head<br>
Of his own child, and pressed it to my cheek<br>
And to my lips, and kissed it o'er and o'er.<br>
All my maternal instincts seemed to rise,<br>
And clamor for their rights, while my wet eyes,<br>
Rained tears upon the silken tress of hair.<br>
The woman struggled with her heart before!<br>
It was the mother in me now did speak,<br>
Moaning, like Rachel, that her babes were not,<br>
And crying out against her barren lot.<br>

<br>

Once I bemoaned the long and lonely years<br>
That stretched before me, dark with love's eclipse;<br>
And thought how my unmated heart would miss<br>
The shelter of a broad and manly breast&#8212;<br>
The strong, bold arm&#8212;the tender clinging kiss&#8212;<br>
And all pure love's possessions, manifold;<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 99]</span>But now I wept a flood of bitter tears,<br>
Thinking of little heads of shining gold,<br>
That would not on my bosom sink to rest;<br>
Of little hands that would not touch my cheek;<br>
Of little lisping voices, and sweet lips,<br>
That never in my list'ning ear would speak<br>
The blessed name of mother.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Oh, in woman<br>
How mighty is the love of offspring! Ere<br>
Unto her wond'ring, untaught mind unfolds<br>
The myst'ry that is half divine, half human,<br>
Of life and birth, the love of unborn souls<br>
Within her, and the mother&#8209;yearning creeps<br>
Through her warm heart, and stirs its hidden deeps,<br>
And grows and strengthens with each riper year.<br>

<br>

As storms may gather in a placid sky,<br>
And spend their fury, and then pass away,<br>
Leaving again the blue of cloudless day,<br>
E'en so the tempest of my grief passed by.<br>
'T was weak to mourn for what I had resigned,<br>
With the deliberate purpose of my mind,<br>
To my sweet friend.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Relinquishing my love,<br>
I gave my dearest hope of joy to her.<br>
If God, from out his boundless store above,<br>
Had chosen added blessings to confer,<br>
I would rejoice, for her sake&#8212;not repine<br>
That th' immortal treasures were not mine.<br>

<br>

Better my lonely sorrow, than to know<br>
My selfish joy had been another's woe;<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 100]</span>Better my grief and my strength to control,<br>
Than the despair of her frail&#8209;bodied soul;<br>
Better to go on, loveless, to the end,<br>
Than wear love's rose, whose thorn had slain my friend.<br>

<br>

Work is the salve that heals the wounded heart.<br>
With will most resolute I set my aim<br>
To enter on the weary race for Fame,<br>
And if I failed to climb the dizzy height,<br>
To reach some point of excellence in art.<br>

<br>

E'en as the Maker held earth incomplete,<br>
Till man was formed, and placed upon the sod,<br>
The perfect, living image of his God,<br>
All landscape scenes were lacking in my sight,<br>
Wherein the human figure had no part.<br>
In that, all lines of symmetry did meet&#8212;<br>
All hues of beauty mingle. So I brought<br>
Enthusiasm in abundance, thought,<br>
Much study, and some talent, day by day,<br>
To help me in my efforts to portray<br>
The wond'rous power, majesty and grace<br>
Stamped on some form, or looking from some face.<br>
This was to be my specialty: To take<br>
Human emotion for my theme, and make<br>
The unassisted form divine express<br>
Anger or Sorrow, Pleasure, Pain, Distress;<br>
And thus to build Fame's monument above<br>
The grave of my departed hope and love.<br>

<br>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 101]</span>This is not Genius. Genius spreads its wings<br>
And soars beyond itself, or selfish things.<br>
Talent has need of stepping&#8209;stones: some cross,<br>
Some cheated purpose, some great pain or loss,<br>
Must lay the groundwork, and arouse ambition,<br>
Before it labors onward to fruition.<br>

<br>

But, as the lark from beds of bloom will rise<br>
And sail and sing among the very skies,<br>
Still mounting near and nearer to the light,<br>
Impelled alone by love of upward flight,<br>
So Genius soars&#8212;it does not need to climb&#8212;<br>
Upon God&#8209;given wings, to heights sublime.<br>
Some sportman's shot, grazing the singer's throat,<br>
Some venomous assault of birds of prey,<br>
May speed its flight toward the realm of day,<br>
And tinge with triumph every liquid note.<br>
So deathless Genius mounts but higher yet,<br>
When Strife and Envy think to slay or fret.<br>

<br>

There is no balking Genius. Only death<br>
Can silence it, or hinder. While there's breath<br>
Or sense of feeling, it will spurn the sod,<br>
And lift itself to glory, and to God.<br>
The acorn sprouted&#8212;weeds nor flowers can choke<br>
The certain growth of th' upreaching oak.<br>

<br>

Talent was mine, not Genius; and my mind<br>
Seemed bound by chains, and would not leave behind<br>
Its selfish love and sorrow.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 102]</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Did I strive<br>
To picture some emotion, lo! <i>his</i> eyes,<br>
Of emerald beauty, dark as ocean dyes,<br>
Looked from the canvas: and my buried pain<br>
Rose from its grave, and stood by me alive.<br>
Whate'er my subject, in some hue or line,<br>
The glorious beauty of his face would shine.<br>

<br>

So for a time my labor seemed in vain,<br>
Since it but freshened, and made keener yet,<br>
The grief my heart was striving to forget.<br>

<br>

While in his form all strength and magnitude<br>
With grace and supple sinews were entwined,<br>
While in his face all beauties were combined<br>
Of perfect features, intellect and truth,<br>
With all that fine rich coloring of youth,<br>
How could my brush portray aught good or fair<br>
Wherein no fatal likeness should intrude<br>
Of him my soul had worshiped?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, at last,<br>
Setting a watch upon my unwise heart<br>
That thus would mix its sorrow with my art,<br>
I resolutely shut away the past,<br>
And made the toilsome present passing bright<br>
With dreams of what was hidden from my sight<br>
In the far distant future, when the soil<br>
Should yield me golden fruit for all my toil.<br>

<blockquote><blockquote>
With much hard labor and some pleasure fraught,<br>
The months rolled by me noiselessly, that taught<br>
My hand to grow more skillful in its art,<br>
Strengthened my daring dream of fame, and brought<br>
Sweet hope and resignation to my heart.<br>

<br>

Brief letters came from Helen, now and then:<br>
She was quite well&#8212;oh, yes! quite well, indeed!<br>
But still so weak and nervous. By and by,<br>
When baby, being older, should not need<br>
Such constant care, she would grow strong again.<br>
She was as happy as a soul could be;<br>
No least cloud hovered in her azure sky;<br>
She had not thought life held such depths of bliss.<br>
Dear baby sent Maurine a loving kiss,<br>
And said she was a naughty, naughty girl,<br>
Not to come home and see ma's little pearl.<br>

<br>

No gift of costly jewels, or of gold,<br>
Had been so precious or so dear to me,<br>
As each brief line wherein her joy was told.<br>
It lightened toil, and took the edge from pain,<br>
Knowing my sacrifice was not in vain.<br>

<br>

Roy purchased fine estates in Scotland, where<br>
He built a pretty villa&#8209;like retreat.<br>
And when the Roman Summer's languid heat<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 104]</span>Made work a punishment, I turned my face<br>
Toward the Highlands, and with Roy and Grace<br>
Found rest and freedom from all thought and care.<br>

<br>

I was a willing worker. Not an hour<br>
Passed idly by me: each, I would employ<br>
To some good purpose, ere it glided on<br>
To swell the tide of hours forever gone.<br>
My first completed picture, known as "Joy,"<br>
Won pleasant words of praise. "Possesses power,"<br>
"Displays much talent," "Very fairly done."<br>
So fell the comments on my grateful ear.<br>

<br>

Swift in the wake of Joy, and always near,<br>
Walks her sad sister Sorrow. So my brush<br>
Began depicting sorrow, heavy&#8209;eyed,<br>
With pallid visage, ere the rosy flush<br>
Upon the beaming face of Joy had dried.<br>
The careful study of long months, it won<br>
Golden opinions; even bringing forth<br>
That certain sign of merit&#8212;a critique<br>
Which set both pieces down as daubs, and weak<br>
As empty heads that sang their praises&#8212;so<br>
Proving conclusively the pictures' worth.<br>
These critics and reviewers do not use<br>
Their precious ammunition to abuse<br>
A worthless work. That, left alone, they know<br>
Will find its proper level; and they aim<br>
Their batteries at rising works which claim<br>
Too much of public notice. But this shot<br>
Resulted only in some noise, which brought<br>
A dozen people, where one came before<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 105]</span>To view my pictures; and I had my hour<br>
Of holding those frail baubles, Fame and Pow'r.<br>
An English Baron who had lived two score<br>
Of his allotted three score years and ten,<br>
Bought both the pieces. He was very kind,<br>
And so attentive, I, not being blind,<br>
Must understand his meaning.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Therefore, when<br>
He said,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Sweet friend, whom I would make my wife,<br>
The 'Joy' and 'Sorrow' this dear hand portrayed<br>
I have in my possession: now resign<br>
Into my careful keeping, and make mine,<br>
The joy and sorrow of your future life,"&#8212;<br>
I was prepared to answer, but delayed,<br>
Grown undecided suddenly.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My mind<br>
Argued the matter coolly pro and con,<br>
And made resolve to speed his wooing on<br>
And grant him favor. He was good and kind;<br>
Not young, no doubt he would be quite content<br>
With my respect, nor miss an ardent love;<br>
Could give me ties of family and home;<br>
And then, perhaps, my mind was not above<br>
Setting some value on a titled name&#8212;<br>
Ambitious woman's weakness!<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then my art<br>
Would be encouraged and pursued the same,<br>
And I could spend my winters all in Rome.<br>
Love never more could touch my wasteful heart<br>
That all its wealth upon one object spent.<br>
Existence would be very bleak and cold,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 106]</span>After long years, when I was gray and old,<br>
With neither home nor children.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once a wife,<br>
I would forget the sorrow of my life,<br>
And pile new sods upon the grave of pain.<br>
My mind so argued; and my sad heart heard,<br>
But made no comment.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then the Baron spoke,<br>
And waited for my answer. All in vain<br>
I strove for strength to utter that one word<br>
My mind dictated. Moments rolled away&#8212;<br>
Until at last my torpid heart awoke,<br>
And forced my trembling lips to say him nay.<br>
And then my eyes with sudden tears o'erran,<br>
In pity for myself and for this man<br>
Who stood before me, lost in pained surprise.<br>
"Dear friend," I cried, "Dear generous friend forgive<br>
A troubled woman's weakness! As I live,<br>
In truth I meant to answer otherwise.<br>
From out its store, my heart can give you naught<br>
But honor and respect; and yet methought<br>
I would give willing answer, did you sue.<br>
But now I know 'twere cruel wrong I planned;<br>
Taking a heart that beat with love most true,<br>
And giving in exchange an empty hand.<br>
Who weds for love alone, may not be wise:<br>
Who weds without it, angels must despise.<br>
Love and respect together must combine<br>
To render marriage holy and divine;<br>
And lack of either, sure as Fate, destroys<br>
Continuation of the nuptial joys,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 107]</span>And brings regret, and gloomy discontent,<br>
To put to rout each tender sentiment.<br>
Nay, nay! I will not burden all your life<br>
By that possession&#8212;an unloving wife;<br>
Nor will I take the sin upon my soul<br>
Of wedding where my heart goes not in whole.<br>
However bleak may be my single lot,<br>
I will not stain my life with such a blot.<br>
Dear friend, farewell! the earth is very wide;<br>
It holds some fairer woman for your bride;<br>
I would I had a heart to give to you,<br>
But, lacking it, can only say&#8212;adieu!"<br>

<br>

He whom temptation never has assailed,<br>
Knows not that subtle sense of moral strength;<br>
When sorely tried, we waver, but at length,<br>
Rise up and turn away, not having failed.<br>

<br>

<hr>

<br>

The Autumn of the third year came and went;<br>
The mild Italian winter was half spent,<br>
When this brief message came across the sea:<br>
"My darling! I am dying. Come to me.<br>
Love, which so long the growing truth concealed,<br>
Stands pale within its shadow. O, my sweet!<br>
This heart of mine grows fainter with each beat&#8212;<br>
Dying with very weight of bliss. O, come!<br>
And take the legacy I leave to you,<br>
Before these lips forevermore are dumb.<br>
In life or death, Yours, Helen Dangerfield."<br>

<br>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 108]</span>This plaintive letter bore a month old date;<br>
And, wild with fears lest I had come too late,<br>
I bade the old world and new friends adieu.<br>
And with Aunt Ruth, who long had sighed for home,<br>
I turned my back on glory, art, and Rome.<br>

<br>

All selfish thoughts were merged in one wild fear<br>
That she for whose dear sake my heart had bled,<br>
Rather than her sweet eyes should know one tear,<br>
Was passing from me; that she might be dead;<br>
And, dying, had been sorely grieved with me,<br>
Because I made no answer to her plea.<br>

<br>

"O, ship, that sailest slowly, slowly on,<br>
Make haste before a wasting life is gone!<br>
Make haste that I may catch a fleeting breath!<br>
And true in life, be true e'en unto death.<br>

<br>

"O, ship, sail on! and bear me o'er the tide<br>
To her for whom my woman's heart once died.<br>
Sail, sail, O, ship! for she hath need of me,<br>
And I would know what her last wish may be!<br>
I have been true, so true, through all the past,<br>
Sail, sail, O, ship! I would not fail at last."<br>

<br>

So prayed my heart still o'er, and ever o'er,<br>
Until the weary lagging ship reached shore.<br>
All sad with fears that I had come too late,<br>
By that strange source whence men communicate,<br>
Though miles on miles of space between them lie,<br>
I spoke with Vivian: "Does she live? Reply."<br>
The answer came. "She lives, but hasten, friend!<br>
Her journey draweth swiftly to its end."<br>

<br>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 109]</span>Ah me! ah me! when each remembered spot,<br>
My own dear home, the lane that led to his&#8212;<br>
The fields, the woods, the lake, burst on my sight,<br>
Oh! then, Self rose up in asserting might;<br>
Oh, then, my bursting heart all else forgot,<br>
But those sweet early years of lost delight,<br>
Of hope, defeat, of anguish and of bliss.<br>

<br>

I have a theory, vague, undefined,<br>
That each emotion of the human mind,<br>
Love, pain or passion, sorrow or despair,<br>
Is a live spirit, dwelling in the air,<br>
Until it takes possession of some breast;<br>
And, when at length, grown weary of unrest,<br>
We rise up strong and cast it from the heart,<br>
And bid it leave us wholly, and depart,<br>
It does not die, it cannot die; but goes<br>
And mingles with some restless wind that blows<br>
About the region where it had its birth.<br>
And though we wander over all the earth,<br>
That spirit waits, and lingers, year by year,<br>
Invisible, and cloth&#232;d like the air,<br>
Hoping that we may yet again draw near,<br>
And it may haply take us unaware,<br>
And once more find safe shelter in the breast<br>
It stirred of old with pleasure or unrest.<br>

<br>

Told by my heart, and wholly positive,<br>
Some old emotion long had ceased to live;<br>
That, were it called, it could not hear or come,<br>
Because it was so voiceless and so dumb,<br>
Yet, passing where it first sprang into life,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 110]</span>My very soul has suddenly been rife<br>
With all the old intensity of feeling.<br>
It seemed a living spirit, which came stealing<br>
Into my heart from that departed day;<br>
Exiled emotion, which I fancied clay.<br>

<br>

So now into my troubled heart, above<br>
The present's pain and sorrow, crept the love<br>
And strife and passion of a by&#8209;gone hour,<br>
Possessed of all their olden might and power.<br>
'T was but a moment, and the spell was broken<br>
By pleasant words of greeting, gently spoken,<br>
And Vivian stood before us.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But I saw<br>
In him the husband of my friend alone.<br>
The old emotions might at times return,<br>
And smold'ring fires leap up an hour and burn;<br>
But never yet had I transgressed God's law,<br>
By looking on the man I had resigned,<br>
With any hidden feeling in my mind,<br>
Which she, his wife, my friend, might not have known.<br>
He was but little altered. From his face<br>
The nonchalant and almost haughty grace,<br>
The lurking laughter waiting in his eyes,<br>
The years had stolen, leaving in their place<br>
A settled sadness, which was not despair,<br>
Nor was it gloom, nor weariness, nor care,<br>
But something like the vapor o'er the skies<br>
Of Indian summer, beautiful to see,<br>
But spoke of frosts, which had been and would be.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 111]</span>There was that in his face which cometh not,<br>
Save when the soul has many a battle fought,<br>
And conquered self by constant sacrifice.<br>

<br>

There are two sculptors, who, with chisels fine,<br>
Render the plainest features half divine.<br>
All other artists strive and strive in vain,<br>
To picture beauty perfect and complete.<br>
Their statues only crumble at their feet,<br>
Without the master touch of Faith and Pain.<br>
And now his face, that perfect seemed before,<br>
Chiseled by these two careful artists, wore<br>
A look exalted, which the spirit gives<br>
When soul has conquered, and the body lives<br>
Subservient to its bidding.<br>
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a room<br>
Which curtained out the February gloom,<br>
And, redolent with perfume, bright with flowers,<br>
Rested the eye like one of Summer's bowers,<br>
I found my Helen, who was less mine now<br>
Than Death's; for on the marble of her brow,<br>
His seal was stamped indelibly.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Her form<br>
Was like the slendor willow, when some storm<br>
Has stripped it bare of foliage. Her face,<br>
Pale always, now was ghastly in its hue:<br>
And, like two lamps, in some dark, hollow place,<br>
Burned her large eyes, grown more intensely blue.<br>
Her fragile hands displayed each cord and vein,<br>
And on her mouth was that drawn look, of pain<br>
Which is not uttered. Yet an inward light<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 112]</span>Shone through and made her wasted features bright<br>
With an unearthly beauty; and an awe<br>
Crept o'er me, gazing on her, for I saw<br>
She was so near to Heaven that I seemed<br>
To look upon the face of one redeemed.<br>
She turned the brilliant luster of her eyes<br>
Upon me. She had passed beyond surprise,<br>
Or any strong emotion linked with clay.<br>
But as I glided to her where she lay,<br>
A smile, celestial in its sweetness, wreathed<br>
Her pallid features. "Welcome home!" she breathed,<br>
"Dear hands! dear lips! I touch you and rejoice."<br>
And like the dying echo of a voice<br>
Were her faint tones that thrilled upon my ear.<br>

<br>

I fell upon my knees beside her bed;<br>
All agonies within my heart were wed,<br>
While to the aching numbness of my grief,<br>
Mine eyes refused the solace of a tear,&#8212;<br>
The tortured soul's most merciful relief.<br>
Her wasted hand caressed my bended head<br>
For one sad, sacred moment. Then she said,<br>
In that low tone so like the wind's refrain,<br>
"Maurine, my own! give not away to pain;<br>
The time is precious. Ere another dawn<br>
My soul may hear the summons and pass on.<br>
Arise, sweet sister! rest a little while,<br>
And when refreshed, come hither. I grow weak<br>
With every hour that passes. I must speak<br>
And make my dying wishes known to&#8209;night.<br>
Go now." And in the halo of her smile,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 113]</span>Which seemed to fill the room with golden light,<br>
I turned and left her.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Later in the gloom,<br>
Of coming night, I entered that dim room,<br>
And sat down by her. Vivian held her hand:<br>
And on the pillow at her side, there smiled<br>
The beauteous count'nance of a sleeping child.<br>

<br>

"Maurine," spoke Helen, "for three blissful years,<br>
My heart has dwelt in an enchanted land;<br>
And I have drank the sweetened cup of joy,<br>
Without one drop of anguish or alloy.<br>
And so, ere Pain embitters it with gall,<br>
Or sad&#8209;eyed Sorrow fills it full of tears,<br>
And bids me quaff, which is the Fate of all<br>
Who linger long upon this troubled way,<br>
God takes me to the realm of Endless Day,<br>
To mingle with his angels, who alone<br>
Can understand such bliss as I have known.<br>
I do not murmur. God has heaped my measure,<br>
In three short years, full to the brim with pleasure;<br>
And, from the fullness of an earthly love,<br>
I pass to th' Immortal arms above,<br>
Before I even brush the skirts of Woe.<br>

<br>

"I leave my aged parents here below,<br>
With none to comfort them. Maurine, sweet friend!<br>
Be kind to them, and love them to the end,<br>
Which may not be far distant.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And I leave<br>
A soul immortal in your charge, Maurine.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 114]</span>From this most holy, sad and sacred eve,<br>
Till God shall claim her, she is yours to keep,<br>
To love and shelter, to protect and guide."<br>
She touched the slumb'ring cherub at her side,<br>
And Vivian gently bore her, still asleep,<br>
And laid the precious burden on my breast.<br>

<br>

A solemn silence fell upon the scene.<br>
And when the sleeping infant smiled, and pressed<br>
My yielding bosom with her waxen cheek,<br>
I felt it would be sacrilege to speak,<br>
Such wordless joy possessed me.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Oh! at last<br>
This infant, who, in that tear&#8209;blotted past,<br>
Had caused my soul such travail, was my own:<br>
Through all the lonely coming years to be<br>
Mine own to cherish&#8212;wholly mine alone.<br>
And what I mourned, so hopelessly as lost<br>
Was now restored, and given back to me.<br>

<br>

The dying voice continued:<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In this child<br>
You yet have me, whose mortal life she cost.<br>
But all that was most pure and undefiled,<br>
And good within me, lives in her again.<br>
Maurine, my husband loves me; yet I know,<br>
Moving about the wide world, to and fro,<br>
And through, and in the busy haunts of men,<br>
Not always will his heart be dumb with woe,<br>
But sometime waken to a later love.<br>
Nay, Vivian, hush! my soul has passed above<br>
All selfish feelings! I would have it so.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 115]</span>While I am with the angels, blest and glad,<br>
I would not have you sorrowing and sad,<br>
In loneliness go mourning to the end.<br>
But, love! I could not trust to any other<br>
The sacred office of a foster&#8209;mother<br>
To this sweet cherub, save my own heart&#8209;friend.<br>

<br>

"Teach her to love her father's name, Maurine,<br>
Where'er he wanders. Keep my memory green<br>
In her young heart, and lead her in her youth,<br>
To drink from th' eternal fount of Truth;<br>
Vex her not with sectarian discourse,<br>
Nor strive to teach her piety by force;<br>
Ply not her mind with harsh and narrow creeds,<br>
Nor frighten her with an avenging God,<br>
Who rules his subjects with a burning rod;<br>
But teach her that each mortal simply needs<br>
To grow in hate of hate and love of love,<br>
To gain a kingdom in the courts above.<br>

<br>

"Let her be free and natural as the flowers,<br>
That smile and nod throughout the summer hours.<br>
Let her rejoice in all the joys of youth,<br>
But first impress upon her mind this truth:<br>
No lasting happiness is e'er attained<br>
Save when the heart some <i>other</i> seeks to please.<br>
The cup of selfish pleasures soon is drained,<br>
And full of gall and bitterness the lees.<br>
Next to her God, teach her to love her land;<br>
In her young bosom light the patriot's flame<br>
Until the heart within her shall expand<br>
With love and fervor at her country's name.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 116]</span>"No coward&#8209;mother bears a valiant son.<br>
And this, my last wish, is an earnest one.<br>

<br>

"Maurine, my o'er&#8209;taxed strength is waning; you<br>
Have heard my wishes, and you will be true<br>
In death as you have been in life, my own!<br>
Now leave me for a little while alone<br>
With him&#8212;my husband. Dear love! I shall rest<br>
So sweetly with no care upon my breast.<br>
Good night, Maurine, come to me in the morning."<br>

<br>

But lo! the bridegroom with no further warning<br>
Came for her at the dawning of the day.<br>
She heard his voice, and smiled, and passed away<br>
Without a struggle.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leaning o'er her bed<br>
To give her greeting, I found but her clay,<br>
And Vivian bowed beside it.<br>

<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And I said,<br>
"Dear friend! my soul shall treasure thy request,<br>
And when the night of fever and unrest<br>
Melts in the morning of Eternity,<br>
Like a freed bird, then I will come to thee.<br>

<br>

"I will come to thee in the morning, sweet!<br>
I have been true; and soul with soul shall meet<br>
Before God's throne, and shall not be afraid.<br>
Thou gav'st me trust, and it was not betrayed.<br>

<br>

"I will come to thee in the morning, dear!<br>
The night is dark. I do not know how near<br>
The morn may be of that Eternal Day;<br>
I can but keep my faithful watch and pray.<br>

<br>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 117]</span>"I will come to thee in the morning, love!<br>
Wait for me on the Eternal Heights above.<br>
The way is troubled where my feet must climb,<br>
Ere I shall tread the mountain&#8209;top sublime.<br>

<br>

"I will come in the morning, O, mine own!<br>
But for a time must grope my way alone,<br>
Through tears and sorrow, till the Day shall dawn,<br>
And I shall hear the summons, and pass on.<br>

<br>

"I will come in the morning. Rest secure!<br>
My hope is certain and my faith is sure.<br>
After the gloom and darkness of the night<br>
I will come to thee with the morning light."<br>

<hr>

<br>

Three peaceful years slipped silently away.<br>

<br>

We dwelt together in my childhood's home,<br>
Aunt Ruth and I, and sunny&#8209;hearted May.<br>
She was a fair and most exquisite child;<br>
Her pensive face was delicate and mild<br>
Like her dead mother's; but through her dear eyes<br>
Her father smiled upon me, day by day.<br>
Afar in foreign countries did he roam,<br>
Now resting under Italy's blue skies,<br>
And now with Roy in Scotland.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And he sent<br>
Brief, friendly letters, telling where he went<br>
And what he saw, addressed to May or me.<br>
And I would write and tell him how she grew&#8212;<br>
And how she talked about him o'er the sea<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 118]</span>In her sweet baby fashion; how she knew<br>
His picture in the album; how each day<br>
She knelt and prayed the blessed Lord would bring<br>
Her own papa back to his little May.<br>

<br>

It was a warm bright morning in the Spring.<br>
I sat in that same sunny portico,<br>
Where I was sitting seven years ago<br>
When Vivian came. My eyes were full of tears,<br>
As I looked back across the checkered years.<br>
How many were the changes they had brought!<br>
Pain, death, and sorrow! but the lesson taught<br>
To my young heart had been of untold worth.<br>
I had learned how to "suffer and grow strong"&#8212;<br>
That knowledge which best serves us here on earth,<br>
And brings reward in Heaven.<br>

<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Oh! how long<br>
The years had been since that June morning when<br>
I heard his step upon the walk, and yet<br>
I seemed to hear its echo still.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Just then<br>
Down that same path I turned my eyes, tear&#8209;wet,<br>
And lo! the wanderer from a foreign land<br>
Stood there before me!&#8212;holding out his hand<br>
And smiling with those wond'rous eyes of old.<br>

<br>

To hide my tears, I ran and brought his child;<br>
But she was shy, and clung to me, when told<br>
This was papa, for whom her prayers were said.<br>
She dropped her eyes and shook her little head,<br>
And would not by his coaxing be beguiled,<br>
Or go to him.<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 119]</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Aunt Ruth was not at home,<br>
And we two sat and talked, as strangers might,<br>
Of distant countries which we both had seen.<br>
But once I thought I saw his large eyes light<br>
With sudden passion, when there came a pause<br>
In our chit&#8209;chat, and then he spoke:<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Maurine,<br>
I saw a number of your friends in Rome.<br>
We talked of you. They seemed surprised, because<br>
You were not 'mong the seekers for a name.<br>
They thought your whole ambition was for fame."<br>

<br>

"It might have been," I answered, "when my heart<br>
Had nothing else to fill it. Now my art<br>
Is but a recreation. I have <i>this</i><br>
To love and live for, which I had not then."<br>
And, leaning down, I pressed a tender kiss<br>
Upon my child's fair brow.<br>

<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And yet," he said,<br>
The old light leaping to his eyes again,<br>
"And yet, Maurine, they say you might have wed<br>
A noble Baron! one of many men<br>
Who laid their hearts and fortunes at your feet.<br>
Why won the bravest of them no return?"<br>

<br>

I bowed my head, nor dared his gaze to meet.<br>
On cheek and brow I felt the red blood burn,<br>
And strong emotion strangled speech.<br>

He murmured softly, "God in Heaven knows<br>
How well I loved you seven years ago.<br>
He only knows my anguish, and my grief,<br>
When your own acts forced on me the belief<br>
That I had been your plaything and your toy.<br>
Yet from his lips I since have learned that Roy<br>
Held no place nearer than a friend and brother.<br>
And then a faint suspicion, undefined,<br>
Of what had been&#8212;was&#8212;might be, stirred my mind,<br>
And that great love, I thought died at a blow,<br>
Rose up within me, strong with hope and life.<br>

<br>

"Before all heaven and the angel mother<br>
Of this sweet child that slumbers on your heart,<br>
Maurine, Maurine, I claim you for my wife&#8212;<br>
Mine own, forever, until death shall part!"<br>

<br>

Through happy mists of upward welling tears,<br>
I leaned, and looked into his beauteous eyes.<br>
"Dear heart," I said, "if she who dwells above<br>
Looks down upon us, from yon azure skies,<br>
She can but bless us, knowing all these years<br>
My soul had yearned in silence for the love<br>
That crowned her life, and left mine own so bleak.<br>
I turned you from me for her fair, frail sake.<br>
For her sweet child's, and for my own, I take<br>
You back to be all mine, for evermore."<br>

<br>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 121]</span>Just then the child upon my breast awoke<br>
From her light sleep, and laid her downy cheek<br>
Against her father as he knelt by me.<br>
And this unconscious action seemed to be<br>
A silent blessing, which the mother spoke<br>
Gazing upon us from the mystic shore.<br>

In the fair morning of his life,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;When his pure heart lay in his breast,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Panting, with all that wild unrest<br>
To plunge into the great world's strife<br>

<br>

That fills young hearts with mad desire,<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;The burning billows surged and rolled,<br>
And upward tossed their caps of fire.<br>

<br>

He looked. And as he looked, the sight<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Sent from his soul through breast and brain<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Such intense joy, it hurt like pain.<br>
His heart seemed bursting with delight.<br>

<br>

So near the Unknown seemed, so close<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;He might have grasped it with his hand.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;He felt his inmost soul expand,<br>
As sunlight will expand a rose.<br>

<br>

One day he heard a singing strain&#8212;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;A human voice, in bird&#8209;like trills.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;He paused, and little rapture&#8209;rills<br>
Went trickling downward through each vein.<br>

<br>

And in his heart the whole day long,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;As in a temple veiled and dim,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;He kept and bore about with him<br>
The beauty of that singer's song.<br>

<br>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 123]</span>And then? But why relate what then?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;His smouldering heart flamed into fire&#8212;<br>

<br>

For years queen Folly held her sway.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;With pleasures of the grosser kind<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;She fed his flesh and drugged his mind,<br>

<br>

He sought his boyhood's home. That hour<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Triumphant should have been, in sooth,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Since he went forth an unknown youth,<br>
And came back crowned with wealth and power.<br>

<br>

The clouds made day a gorgeous bed;<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;With unmoved heart and stolid eye;<br>
He only knew the West was red.<br>

<br>

Then suddenly a fresh young voice<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Rose, bird&#8209;like, from some hidden place,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;He did not even turn his face;<br>
It struck him simply as a noise.<br>

He trod the old paths up and down.<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;But I paused in my journey ere night,<br>
For the way grew so lonely and troubled;<br>
I said&#8212;my anxiety doubled&#8212;<br>
"This is not the road to Content."<br>

<br>

Then I joined the great rabble and throng<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;That frequents the moneyed world's mart;<br>
But the greed, and the grasping and wrong,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Left me only one wish&#8212;to depart.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;And sickened, and saddened at heart,<br>
I hurried away from the gateway,<br>
For my soul and my spirit said straightway,<br>
"This is not the road to Content."<br>

<br>

Then weary in body and brain,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;An overgrown path I detected,<br>
And I said "I will hide with my pain<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;In this by&#8209;way, unused and neglected."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Lo! it led to the realm God selected<br>
To crown with his best gifts of beauty,<br>
And through the dark pathway of duty<br>
I came to the land of Content.<br>

In the rapture of life and of living,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;I lift up my heart and rejoice,<br>
And I thank the great Giver for giving<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;The soul of my gladness a voice.<br>
In the glow of the glorious weather,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;In the sweet&#8209;scented sensuous air,<br>

I can laugh at the world and its sages&#8212;<br>

For he is most wise in all ages<br>

I lift up my eyes to Apollo,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;The god of the beautiful days,<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;And is lost in the light of its rays.<br>
Are you troubled and sad? I beseech you<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Come out of the shadows of strife&#8212;<br>
Come out in the sun while I teach you<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;The secret of life.<br>

Come up where the dust never rises&#8212;<br>

As some dusk mother shields from all alarms<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;The tired child she gathers to her breast,<br>
The brunette Night doth fold me in her arms,<br>

I see what <i>is</i>&#8212;no longer what doth seem.<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;And whisper of the vastly Infinite.<br>
Great, blue&#8209;eyed Truth, her sister Purity,<br>

Last night I knelt low at my lady's feet.<br>
One soft, caressing hand played with my hair,<br>
And one I kissed and fondled. Kneeling there,<br>
I deemed my meed of happiness complete.<br>

<br>

She was so fair, so full of witching wiles&#8212;<br>
Of fascinating tricks of mouth and eye;<br>
So womanly withal, but not too shy&#8212;<br>
And all my heaven was compassed by her smiles.<br>

<br>

Her soft touch on my cheek and forehead sent,<br>
Like little arrows, thrills of tenderness<br>
Through all my frame. I trembled with excess<br>
Of love, and sighed the sigh of great content.<br>

<br>

When any mortal dares to so rejoice,<br>
I think a jealous Heaven, bending low,<br>
Reaches a stern hand forth and deals a blow.<br>
Sweet through the dusk I heard my lady's voice.<br>

<br>

"My love!" she sighed, "My Carlos!" even now<br>
I feel the perfumed zephyr of her breath<br>
Bearing to me those words of living death,<br>
And starting out the cold drops on my brow.<br>

<br>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 181]</span>For I am <i>Paul</i>&#8212;not Carlos! Who is he<br>
That, in the supreme hour of love's delight,<br>
Veiled by the shadows of the falling night,<br>
She should breathe low his name, forgetting me?<br>

<br>

I will not ask her! 'twere a fruitless task,<br>
For, woman&#8209;like, she would make me believe<br>
Some well&#8209;told tale; and sigh, and seem to grieve,<br>
And call me cruel. Nay, I will not ask.<br>

<br>

But this man Carlos, whosoe'er he be,<br>
Has turned my cup of nectar into gall,<br>
Since I know he has claimed some one or all<br>
Of these delights my lady grants to me.<br>

<br>

He must have knelt and kissed her, in some sad<br>
And tender twilight, when the day grew dim.<br>
How else could I remind her so of him?<br>
Why, reveries like these have made men mad!<br>

<br>

He must have felt her soft hand on his brow.<br>
If Heaven was shocked at such presumptuous wrongs,<br>
And plunged him in the grave, where he belongs,<br>
<i>Still she remembers</i>, though she loves me now.<br>

<br>

And if he lives, and meets me to his cost,<br>
Why, what avails it? I must hear and see<br>
That curst name "Carlos" always haunting me&#8212;<br>
So has another Paradise been lost.<br>

From the heads of kings I have torn the crown;<br>

But I can tell of hearts that were sad<br>
By my crystal drops made bright and glad;<br>
Of thirsts I have quenched, and brows I have laved;<br>
Of hands I have cooled, and souls I have saved.<br>
I have leaped through the valley, dashed down the mountain,<br>
Slept in the sunshine, and dripped from the fountain.<br>
I have burst my cloud&#8209;fetters, and dropped from the sky.<br>
And everywhere gladdened the prospect and eye;<br>
I have eased the hot forehead of fever and pain;<br>
I have made the parched meadows grow fertile with grain.<br>
I can tell of the powerful wheel of the mill,<br>
That ground out the flour, and turned at my will.<br>
I can tell of manhood debased by you,<br>
That I have uplifted and crowned anew<br>
I cheer, I help, I strengthen and aid;<br>
I gladden the heart of man and maid;<br>
I set the wine&#8209;chained captive free,<br>
And all are better for knowing me."<br>

So tired is he of kisses<br>

For he has had his season,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Like the lily and the rose,<br>

So dusk the shades at landing time,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 205]</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;We could not see each other's eyes.<br>
We only saw the moonbeams quiver<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Far down upon the stream! that night<br>
The new moon gave but little light<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;By Leudemann's&#8209;on&#8209;the&#8209;River.<br>

How dusky were those paths that led<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Up from the river to the hall.<br>
The tall trees branching overhead<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Invite the early shades that fall.<br>
In all the glad blithe world, oh, never<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Were hearts more free from care than when<br>
We wandered through those walks, we ten,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;By Leudemann's&#8209;on&#8209;the&#8209;River.<br>

<br>

So soon, so soon, the changes came.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;This August day we two alone,<br>
On that same river, not the same,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Dream of a night forever flown.<br>
Strange distances have come to sever<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;The hearts that gayly beat in pleasure,<br>
Long miles we cannot cross or measure&#8212;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;From Leudemann's&#8209;on&#8209;the&#8209;River.<br>

<br>

We'll pluck two leaves, dear friend, to&#8209;day.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;The green, the russet! seems it strange<br>
So soon, so soon, the leaves can change!<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Ah, me! so runs all life away.<br>
This night wind chills me, and I shiver;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;The Summer time is almost past.<br>
One more good&#8209;bye&#8212;perhaps the last<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;To Leudemann's&#8209;on&#8209;the&#8209;River.<br>

One took the hot&#8209;house blossoms from her breast,<br>

Somebody said, in the crowd, last eve,<br>

I have not thought of you, I believe,<br>

Five long Summers have passed since then&#8212;<br>

Again you were mine by Love's own right&#8212;<br>

"By&#8209;and&#8209;by," the mother cried&#8212;"by&#8209;and&#8209;by,<br>
Strong and sturdy at my side,<br>
Like a staff supporting me,<br>
Will my bonnie baby be.<br>
Break my rest, then, wail and cry&#8212;<br>
Thou'lt repay me by&#8209;and&#8209;by&#8212;by&#8209;and&#8209;by."<br>

<br>

Fleeting years of time have sped&#8212;hurried by&#8212;<br>
Still the maiden is unwed;<br>
All unknown the soldier lies,<br>
Buried under alien skies;<br>
And the son, with blood&#8209;shot eye<br>
Saw his mother starve and die.<br>
God in Heaven! dost Thou on high,<br>
Keep the promised by&#8209;and&#8209;by&#8212;by&#8209;and&#8209;by?<br>

<blockquote><blockquote>
All through the night time, and all through the day time,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Dreading the morning and dreading the night,<br>
Nearer and nearer we drift to the May time<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Season of beauty and season of blight,<br>
Leaves on the linden, and sun on the meadow,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Green in the garden, and bloom everywhere,<br>
Gloom in my heart, and a terrible shadow,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Walks by me, sits by me, stands by my chair.<br>

<br>

Oh, but the birds by the brooklet are cheery,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Oh, but the woods show such delicate greens,<br>
Strange how you droop and how soon you are weary&#8212;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Too well I know what that weariness means.<br>
But how could I know in the crisp winter weather<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;(Though sometimes I noticed a catch in your breath),<br>
Riding and singing and dancing together,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;How could I know you were racing with death?<br>

<br>

How could I know when we danced until morning,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;And you were the gayest of all the gay crowd&#8212;<br>
With only that shortness of breath for a warning,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;How could I know that you danced for a shroud?<br>
Whirling and whirling through moonlight and starlight,<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 232]</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Rocking as lightly as boats on the wave,<br>
Down in your eyes shone a deep light&#8212;a far light,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;How could I know 'twas the light to your grave?<br>

<br>

Day by day, day by day, nearing and nearing,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Hid under greenness, and beauty and bloom,<br>
Cometh the shape and the shadow I'm fearing,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;"Over the May hill" is waiting your tomb.<br>
The season of mirth and of music is over&#8212;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;I have danced my last dance, I have sung my last song,<br>
Under the violets, under the clover,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;My heart and my love will be lying ere long.<br>

<h2>A SONG.</h2>

<blockquote><blockquote>
Is any one sad in the world, I wonder?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Does any one weep on a day like this,<br>
With the sun above, and the green earth under?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Why, what is life but a dream of bliss?<br>

<br>

With the sun, and the skies, and the birds above me,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Birds that sing as they wheel and fly&#8212;<br>
With the winds to follow and say they love me&#8212;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Who could be lonely? O ho, not I!<br>

<br>

Somebody said, in the street this morning,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;As I opened my window to let in the light,<br>
That the darkest day of the world was dawning;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;But I looked, and the East was a gorgeous sight.<br>

<br>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 233]</span>One who claims that he knows about it<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Tells me the Earth is a vale of sin;<br>
But I and the bees and the birds&#8212;we doubt it,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;And think it a world worth living in.<br>

<br>

Some one says that hearts are fickle,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;That love is sorrow, that life is care,<br>
And the reaper Death, with his shining sickle,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Gathers whatever is bright and fair.<br>

<br>

I told the thrush, and we laughed together,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Laughed till the woods were all a&#8209;ring:<br>
And he said to me, as he plumed each feather,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, people must croak, if they cannot sing."<br>

<br>

Up he flew, but his song, remaining,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Rang like a bell in my heart all day,<br>
And silenced the voices of weak complaining,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;That pipe like insects along the way.<br>

<br>

O world of light, and O world of beauty!<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Where are there pleasures so sweet as thine?<br>
Yes, life is love, and love is duty;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;And what heart sorrows? O no, not mine!<br>

Thank Fate for foes! I hold mine dear<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;As valued friends. He cannot know<br>
The zest of life who runneth here<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;His earthly race without a foe.<br>

<br>

I saw a prize. "Run," cried my friend;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;"'Tis thine to claim without a doubt."<br>
But ere I half&#8209;way reached the end,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;I felt my strength was giving out.<br>

<br>

My foe looked on the while I ran;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;A scornful triumph lit his eyes.<br>
With that perverseness born in man,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;I nerved myself, and won the prize.<br>

<br>

All blinded by the crimson glow<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Of sin's disguise, I tempted Fate.<br>
"I knew thy weakness!" sneered my foe,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;I saved myself, and balked his hate.<br>

<br>

For half my blessings, half my gain,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;I needs must thank my trusty foe;<br>
Despite his envy and disdain,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;He serves me well where'er I go.<br>

<br>

So may I keep him to the end,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor may his enmity abate:<br>
More faithful than the fondest friend,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;He guards me ever with his hate.<br>

<blockquote><blockquote>
Dear friend, I pray thee, if thou wouldst be proving<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Thy strong regard for me,<br>
Make me no vows. Lip&#8209;service is not loving;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Let thy faith speak for thee.<br>

<br>

Swear not to me that nothing can divide us&#8212;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;So little such oaths mean.<br>
But when distrust and envy creep beside us<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Let them not come between.<br>

<br>

Say not to me the depths of thy devotion<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Are deeper than the sea;<br>
But watch, lest doubt or some unkind emotion<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Embitter them for me.<br>

<br>

Vow not to love me ever and forever,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Words are such idle things;<br>
But when we differ in opinions, never<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Hurt me by little stings.<br>

<br>

I'm sick of words: they are so lightly spoken,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;And spoken, are but air.<br>
I'd rather feel thy trust in me unbroken<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Than list thy words so fair.<br>

<br>

If all the little proofs of trust are heeded,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;If thou art always kind,<br>
No sacrifice, no promise will be needed<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;To satisfy my mind.<br>
